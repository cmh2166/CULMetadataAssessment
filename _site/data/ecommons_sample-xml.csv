Winner of the Abrams Prize for the Best Senior Honors Thesis in English.","This thesis examines the exegetical, intellectual-historical, and theoretical implications of a particular feature of Philip Sidney?s late sixteenth-century sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella:  its continual anxiety over authenticity ? a term I use to signal the ability of its fictional speaker (Astrophil) to find a language capable of conveying his internal cognitive and affective states.  Throughout Sidney?s sequence, Astrophil attempts to define an authentic lyrical language by both criticizing other poets and asserting a formal agenda for his own texts.  His texts, however, continually contradict in practice what is demanded of them in theory so that the sequence shows an underlying pessimism summed up in Sonnet 35?s question: ?What may words say, or what may words not say, / Where Truth itself must speake like Flatterie?? (my emphasis).
This paradox and the pessimism it produces, I argue, can be understood by situating Sidney?s sequence in a rift between two conceptual frameworks for understanding relations between subjectivity, language, and the material world.  In one framework (dominant in western medieval Christendom), cognition, language, and material things were seen as ontologically homogenous ? part of the same sublunary, postlapsarian material stratum.  But in another framework ? emerging in the sixteenth century and that would become dominant in western European modernity ? human subjects and their languages were seen as detached from the material world.   Sidney?s sequence, I suggest, is stuck between these two ideological polarities.  It wants to enact an authenticity that would become possible under the conceptual regime of modernity, where language is imbricated in the immaterial cognitive circuitry of sovereign, Cartesian subjects, and where it thus becomes capable of conveying the authenticity attributed to in modern ideologies of the aesthetic.  However, Sidney is caught in the conceptual space of an older model of language:  one that sees it as something thingly, ontologically homogenous with the material world.  
My first chapter introduces ? somewhat lengthily ? the problem of authenticity in Astrophil and Stella.  It develops some of the intellectual-historical horizons I want to situate the sequence in and introduces the main textual feature I want to follow:  Sidney?s tendency, in attempting to establish the authenticity of his own poetry, to criticize other poets for their lack of authenticity vis-?-vis a resemblance between their poetic practices and commercial and economic practices.  My second chapter both turns to the contemporary critical landscape of early modern studies and provides further elaboration of my positioning of Sidney in the ambiguities of early modern concepts of subjectivity, language, and materiality.  After this lengthy prefatory, I move on, in my third chapter, to read Astrophil and Stella, focusing particularly on Sidney?s use of the word ?strange? ? a term that particularly points to the rift I want to chart in the sequence.  My fourth chapter concludes with a methodological question:  how do the points I have made about the difference between modern and early modern ontologies of language, materiality, and subjectivity effect the contemporary critical landscape of early modern literary studies.  Particularly, I pursue the question of whether or not a return to formalism and aestheticism (increasingly called for in protest to the dominance of cultural studies in literary interpretation) has a trans-historical exegetical validity.  In conclusion, I suggest that the assumptions on which such a return to the literary would stand become deeply problematic outside of the modern era.","Made available in DSpace on 2006-05-17T20:40:21Z (GMT).

In A Sketch of the Past, Woolf describes the experience of these shocks and her immediate desire to explain them, presenting writing as a reparative activity that imparts meaning to the apparently senseless and alleviates pain by creating wholeness out of fragmentation.  She illustrates this concept by providing three examples from her own childhood, each of which offers a very different model of experience.  In this thesis I relate these shocks to the structure of Jacob?s Room and a number of strangely digressive and open-ended passages within it, proposing that the novel actually resists Woolf's own model of reparative writing and does not process shocks into wholes for the reader so much as transmit them to her.","Made available in DSpace on 2006-05-30T13:47:09Z (GMT).

Objective techniques to assess chair comfort necessitate the use of a sensing layer that may change the fundamental characteristics of the chair itself depending on its structure and materials. Other methods have attached equipment to subjects, which may influence their normal sitting behavior. In this study, I utilize new 3D body scanning technology to examine the person-chair interaction in flexible, material back chairs without adding anything to either the chair or the subject. I attempt to develop a new objective measure, volumetric deformation, which assesses the reaction of a flexible, material chair back to a seated user. In addition, this study aims to understand the relationships between perceived chair back comfort, objective volumetric deformation, subject anthropometric attributes, and ratings of perceived chair attribute comfort. Total chair back deformation is found to be significantly related to some subject anthropometric attributes, which provides further evidence that deformation is a useful objective measure for assessment of the chair back. Perceived overall back comfort is significantly associated to the perceived comfort of the lumbar support but not to any of the anthropometric measurements taken. The relationship between chair back deformation and pressure distribution should be explored in future studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2006-06-05T16:40:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Reactions from the grassroots have emerged as citizens strive to address urban needs independently of planning bodies. However, many would argue that this is not the answer either.

<br>Planning at the level of urban administration currently coexists in tension with planning at the grassroots level. Planning from the top is attempting to be more attentive to needs in the neighborhoods, as citizens have begun to acquire the energy and resources to lobby for change. Oftentimes, government-grassroots partnerships are forged to exploit the capacities of both entities in planning endeavors. However, this leads to the question of how this tension creates opportunities for improvements of social conditions, whether it contributes to the larger vision of enlarging the political capacity of a society, and which is the appropriate body to make a plan and implement it.

<br>A government-grassroots partnership was attempted in the City of Rochester, through the Neighbors Building Neighborhoods (NBN) program. The year 2006 marks the 13th year of the program. After 13 years of negotiations, consultation, community meetings, conflict, and lobbying, numerous milestones have been achieved. Through NBN, hundreds of neighborhood projects have come to fruition, while many others have broken ground. These projects include physical improvements, beautification projects, the construction of new schools and stores, better public services, and increased public safety measures. NBN also received awards for its successful neighborhood revitalization efforts, and is recognized as a model of best practices.

<br>Many people in Rochester are happy with the achievements made through NBN. However, some believe that the process can be further modified for greater success. The recent election of a new mayor into the Rochester City administration has resulted in some uncertainty in the future of NBN ? will the process continue as it, be modified, or go down in history as a pet project of the previous administration?
This thesis examines the NBN process to:
1. document the NBN process in Rochester an example of government-initiated grassroots-planning action that other city planning organizations can refer to;
2. place the era of NBN in the context of Rochester's history as a city of citizen action; and
3. explore NBN as Rochester's solution to the problem of the appropriate bodies to make a plan and implement it.","Made available in DSpace on 2006-10-07T17:22:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Respondents were presented with a gambling task and were shown two spinners, one offering a sure gain (or loss), the second offering a gamble (probabilities of the gamble included ?, 1/3 and ?; magnitudes of the gamble included low, medium and high monetary amounts).  Participants received 18 trials, nine framed as gains and nine framed as losses (each gain condition was analogous to a loss condition) and individuals were asked to report their confidence after each scenario.  In the gain frame, respondents began with nothing and were offered a choice between a sure gain and a gamble offering the possibility of winning larger amounts or winning nothing.  For the loss frame, individuals were given an endowment and could lose an amount for sure or take a chance and risk losing nothing or risk losing everything.  In each corresponding gain and loss pair, the net sum that could be won was kept equal.  In addition, respondents completed surveys on sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation.  
Data analysis was conducted both without and with the confidence ratings.  In both regressions, delinquents scored significantly higher on sensation seeking in the gain frame, but not in the loss frame.  In the first ANOVA, magnitude was a significant effect as was the interaction between magnitude and the population of the participant.  Delinquents were more likely to choose the gamble regardless of the magnitude, while undergraduates picked the sure option at higher magnitudes.  Also, a three way interaction was found between framing, probability and magnitude.  The second ANOVA, replicated these findings and probability became a significant effect.  Such results highlight the potential benefit of programs that work to enhance decision-making processes in order to prevent initial crime or potential recidivism.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-05-22T13:20:45Z (GMT).

What are the impacts and how can these demands be balanced in a responsible, progressive and humanitarian way?

This research uses a political ecology framework to discuss the sociocultural, economic and environmental implications of Chilean forest management practices.  This is a critical analysis of the Chilean government?s priorities, which currently promote an extractive export economy at high social and environmental costs.  Despite a growing economy, the wealth disparity in the country is vast and continues to expand.  I argue that the government must reorient its focus away from GDP and toward more valuable measures of the country?s health. Public funds need to be redistributed to benefit the people in the country and the country?s natural treasures rather than subsidizing private industry to attract wealthy foreign investors. This shift in priorities must be implemented in strong, creative policy that supports simultaneous economic growth, environmental preservation, and social justice. 
This project is based on personal experiences, interviews and observations from when I lived in Chile during the spring of 2006, as well as on secondary sources that provide scientific and statistical evidence.  I describe the history of the forest plantation development, the government?s role in creating the industry that exists today, and current statistics that show the scope and significance of the industry.  Different sources present conflicting evidence depending on their interests, demonstrating the complexity of the controversies around the social and ecological impacts of the forest plantations.  Various avenues for change are possible: policy restructuring, market control methods, improved ecological management, and social and environmental activism promoting government and citizen awareness and responsibility.  Government leaders are integral to promoting human rights and environmental preservation and it is their responsibility to prioritize these goals at least as much as private investment.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-05-31T21:44:37Z (GMT).

Self-generated hypotheses should elicit a stronger confirmation bias than other-generated hypotheses, possibly because the generation of a hypothesis requires an initial assessment of plausibility (Schunn & Klahr, 1993).  Plausibility is determined by considering a possible cause within a network of prior knowledge about the world (Koslowski, 1996).  Our study examines the testing of genuine explanations in non-emotion-laden, complex causal reasoning situations.  We predict that the source of the explanation (self or other) and presence of alternative explanations will influence ability to distinguish between two hypotheses.  Furthermore, we predict that the incorporation of prior knowledge into the hypothesis test will allow individuals to distinguish more successfully.  Sixty subjects (F = 32, aged 18-22) completed a structured interview evaluating explanations that varied on number of explanations present and source of explanation.  Ability to distinguish between a target explanation and its complement (but not a genuine alternative) was shown to differ based on the source (self or other) of the target and whether an alternative was provided.  Prior knowledge was only used when distinguishing between the target and a genuine alternative.  In general, the use of a contrast or covariation test is the best predictor of ability to distinguish between two explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-10T15:53:03Z (GMT).

Indigenous reindeer herding practices and cultural strategies link the survivability of the people with the survivability of their reindeer.

The period of Soviet occupation in Mongolia from 1921 to 1991 caused massive damage to the social fabric of Tsaatan culture and also herd health. Since 1991, the Tsaatan have been attempting to revive their culture in post-soviet, Mongolian democracy. Through dairy, packing, riding, meat and other by-products, reindeer provide the raw materials and power the Tsaatan need to survive in this cold mountainous region of Mongolia.

Though a multitude of health problems effect the herd today including inbreeding and zoonotic diseases such as Brucellosis, I believe the herd?s recovery is predicated on first establishing better herd nutrition. Herd demographic data collected by myself and other researchers in 2006 showed a correlation between herd body condition and management strategies/forage quality [Appendix 1]. With the underlying assumption that heard health is influenced by nutrition, this study set out to collect the first set of data on forage availability/quality in Tsaatan pastures. My hypothesis was that both availability and diet composition vary from other reindeer groups and warrant a dynamic set of considerations in terms of best-management policies for the herd.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-20T19:51:41Z (GMT).

The objective was to determine the early effects (0-6h) of concentrate type on rumen pH and forage digestion. Two forages, orchard grass and corn (Zea mays L.) stover, were combined in a 50:50 ratio with 5 concentrate treatments (no concentrate, corn meal, corn gluten meal, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)  and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)). Samples were incubated in vitro in a 1:4 buffer to rumen fluid mixture for 420 min. The pH was measured at intervals throughout the trial and samples were collected for volatile fatty acid (VFA) analysis.  Forage samples alone had significantly lower pH (P<0.05) than those samples containing concentrate. For corn stover samples, this correlates with a high mean lactic acid concentration (535 ppm). The final study measured change in pH and the difference in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility of four concentrate treatments (no concentrate, corn meal, corn gluten meal, and barley). Two sample distribution methods were tested; forage and concentrate were mixed together in the same filter bag or separated into individual bags.  Barley had the largest inhibitory effect on fiber digestion and caused the largest decline in pH. Treatments with feeds in the same bag showed larger differences in pH and digestibility. Results suggest a diet containing a mixture of forages or, a mixture of corn and forage minimizes declines in rumen pH. They also suggest the study of associative effects is impeded by separation of feeds through filter bags.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-21T12:38:48Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The 148 isolates collected from the 74 calves were tested using a broth tube dilution method for determining resistance to several antimicrobial agents (n=14): AMP, APR, CEF, CHL, ENR, FLO, GEN, NEO, OXY, SPE, SCH, SDI, STH, and TRI. Considering resistance to individual drugs, the percent of E.coli isolates with resistance was over 50 for 11 drugs and the percent of Salmonella isolates resistant was over 50 for 9 drugs. From the antimicrobial resistance patterns generated for E.coli (n=42) and Salmonella (n= 22), the bacteria were found to have 6 identical patterns in common. From these 6 patterns the most common pattern showed resistance to AMP, CEF, CHL, FLO, NEO, OXY, SCH, SDI, and STH. The association of antimicrobial resistance between Salmonella and E.coli for the same calves for individual antimicrobial agents proved not statistically significant. This study showed that resistance to drug classes important in human and animal medicine was common in Salmonella and E.coli from clinically ill calves. Overall, E.coli isolates were more resistant than Salmonella. While there were shared patterns of resistance (n=6) between Salmonella and E.coli, Salmonella isolates were not significantly more likely to be resistant to individual antibiotics if a calf had a resistant E.coli. Results suggest that selection pressure from recent exposure to drugs or interspecific gene transfer was not resulting in a strong association of resistance between the bacteria.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-21T12:50:07Z (GMT).

The effects of weaning age in beef cattle fed an all forage diet on measure of weight gain and carcass quality were analyzed over two years of calf data.  Measures of gain included average daily gain, weight per day of age (WDA), and weight at the conclusion of trial two weaning (CW2).  Measures of carcass quality included  percent intramuscular fat, Longissimus muscle area (REA), rib fat (BF), finished live-weight (FW), rump fat (RF) at the conclusion of trial two weaning, empty body fat (EBF) and Longissimus muscle area as a function of finished weight (REA/FW). Angus x Simmental beef calves (N=50 over two years) were weaned at two distinct ages. In both trials, calves were weaned using a calf-weaner, a plastic removable nose ring used for low stress weaning.  In trial one calves were weaned at the time normally practiced, approximately 157 (+13) days of age in 2004 and 182.7 (+ 9.7) days of age in 2005. In trial two the time of weaning was delayed to 338.5 (+ 13.6) days of age in 2004 and 266.1 (+ 8.4) days of age in 2005.  Following weaning in both trails, calves were fed an all forage diet. For calves born in 2004, carcass data for both weaning groups was gathered by ultrasound at 597(+ 13.6) days of age; in 2005, calves from both trails were analyzed by ultrasound at approximately 554(+ 8.9) days of age. The calves in which weaning was delayed showed numerically higher values for percent intramuscular fat, rib eye area, rump fat, back fat, finished weight, weight per day of age, empty body fat (percent), and rib eye area as a function of finished weight. These differences however were generally not statistically significant using the general linear model in SAS (1998), and analyzing least square means using The Waller-Duncan K-ratio t test.  There was a statistically significant difference in WDA and CW2 for 2005 born calves.   The results of this research potentially show a relationship between delaying weaning and an increase in the carcass quality of forage finished beef.  As farmers producing forage finished beef seek to compete for market share in a market primarily dominated by grain finished, highly marbled, younger carcasses, a delay in weaning age may produce carcasses which are more highly competitive in the current market and capable of better suiting consumer preferences.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-21T16:55:08Z (GMT).

This study?s main objective was to determine the effect of age on the immunological competency of sheep in order to determine the optimal schedule for vaccinating lambs. An experiment was designed to examine the ability of lambs of varying ages to mount an antigen-specific immune response against Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) after vaccination with KLH in 10% aluminum hydroxide as the adjuvant. Groups of five lambs were vaccinated subcutaneously with one of three treatments (vaccine, control, adjuvant only) three times at two week intervals over a total of six weeks. The age at administration of the treatment was also variable (n=5); the lambs were either 0, 5, or 40 weeks of age at the start of their respective six week vaccine trial. Three blood samples were taken immediately prior to the second and third treatment and two weeks after the third. Lymphocyte proliferation, and production of total immunoglobulin (Ig), and KLH-specific Ig were measured. An increase in lymphocyte production in vaccinated animals in response to vaccines was seen as early as 4 weeks of age, after two vaccines. The production of anti-KLH Ab in vaccinated lambs began after the first vaccination and had a fold response four times as high as control and adjuvant-only animals when sampled two weeks after the first vaccination.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-21T17:01:18Z (GMT).

I hypothesized that if there is selection for singing ability and not just for an increase in repertoire size, it could be expected that syllable consistency should be (1) higher in older, more experienced individuals, (2) higher in species with higher potential for sexual selection via female choice (i.e. higher in the northern versus the tropical mockingbird) and (3) higher in males expected to be of higher quality (i.e. in dominant versus subordinate birds). I found that song consistency could be improved with practice because tropical mockingbirds became more consistent with age. When comparing across male types, I found that consistency was higher in northern and dominant tropical mockingbirds than in subordinate tropical mockingbirds (although the data suggests that dominant tropical mockingbirds that compete with subordinates for breeding may not be much better singers than these subordinates). I suggest that the lack of significant differences between northern mockingbirds and dominant tropical mockingbirds could be a product of a trade-off between repertoire size and singing consistency because as the number of types in a repertoire increases, the opportunities to practice each type are reduced.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-21T17:09:39Z (GMT).

However, Delena cancerides, a social huntsman spider from southern Australia, is the only social spider known to respond aggressively to introduced non-relatives and has been shown to preferentially consume non-kin in starvation experiments.  It is hypothesized that chemical cues mediate the differentiation of related colony mates from non-colony mates, and that D. cancerides prefer exposure to cues derived from their natal colony to those derived from an alien colony.  I used a three choice olfactometer to implement an olfactory preference assay with D. cancerides, using the degree of exploration in the olfactometer to divide trials into three analyzable groups.  Movement within the olfactometer during trials was highly non-random.  Spiders in the group characterized by exploration of both the same-colony and foreign-colony stimuli settled with their same-colony stimulus at the end of the trial significantly more than predicted by chance.

Spiders spent significantly more time in the presence of conspecific stimuli, from either same- or foreign-colonies, than predicted by random motion in two of three trial groups, suggesting that recognition of conspecifics and the tendency to aggregate is also mediated chemically.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-21T17:29:57Z (GMT).

Commercial insecticide control of house flies is limited to a few chemicals, and the development of resistance to these chemicals is an ongoing concern.  Therefore, finding new effective insecticides is critical.  
Spinosad is a relatively new promising insecticide that was released in 2005 for house fly control.  It is derived from the bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa.  It is highly effective against pest species and is thought to have a unique mode of action.  A resistant laboratory house fly strain was developed and studies indicate the resistance mechanism is unique, recessive, and located on autosome 1.  
Although house fly resistance to spinosad has been developed in the laboratory, resistance in field populations has not been characterized.  In this study I monitored spinosad resistance at several dairy, hog and poultry farms over the summers of 2004 and 2005.  Results showed that there was a variation in baseline susceptibility between different field sites, but no development of resistance was observed.  Due to limitations of insecticide bioassays, developing a more sensitive resistance detection method and identifying the gene responsible for resistance will be important for future monitoring programs.
As part of an important step in determining the gene for resistance, I linked a number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits to a particular house fly autosome.  Spinosad toxicity is due to interactions with nAChRs and is associated with autosome 1.  Of the four genes analyzed, two (Md?5 and Md?6) were associated with autosome 1, one (Md?2) was associated with autosome 2, and one gene association (Md?3) was not determined.  
Lastly, I assessed the fitness effects of spinosad resistance on mating competition.  I found that a laboratory susceptible strain had a mating advantage over a laboratory spinosad resistant strain.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-22T16:06:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I compared the frequency of infection in females in mating pairs with that of ambient non-mating females to determine if the frequency of infection was significantly lower in mating females. In addition, to test the assumption that infected males were physiologically incapable of initiating copulatory behavior, I compared the infection prevalence of mating males with that of non-mating ambient males. I found that there was no significant difference in the infection prevalence between mating and non-mating females, indicating that males were not distinguishing between infected and uninfected females.  This may be the case due to high levels of gene flow between highly infected and unexposed populations, insignificant costs associated with wasted mating attempts for males, or low heritability of the means for detecting infection in females.  Infection prevalence in mating males was nearly significantly lower than that of non-mating males. However, the surprising frequency of infected males mating (15%) suggests that gonad health is not a pre-requisite for initiating copulatory behavior.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-22T16:36:26Z (GMT).

3.	Are clients satisfied with landscape architectural services? 
4.	Do landscape architects involve users on a regular basis?
5.	Is there a set of best practices to adopt when working with clients? 

The results showed that landscape architects focused on understanding the needs of their clients from the beginning of the design process through one-on-one communication with them.  This input was incorporated into designs to the satisfaction of the clients.  Landscape architects felt that part of their job was to educate clients about good design.  This allows their practical and creative input to combine with the client?s producing a design that satisfies their needs and holds up over time.  Clients appreciate the practical recommendations and high level of communication that the landscape architects offer.

Users do not participate in the design process on a day-to-day basis, although most firms work with them sporadically.  The methods for working with them are not well defined by the interviewees.

Both client and user involvement is limited by budget constraints, project type, and client wishes.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-26T18:56:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I identified that the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) could be used as an appropriate social science foundation to improve the program design and the identification of additional implementation actions.  Most implementation actions seemed to focus on the monitoring of nest success and fledging rate of protected bird species that nest on beaches and reacting to public behaviors that are disturbing to these birds.  According to TPB, additional benefits likely could be achieved by developing implementation actions focused on proactively engaging the public to prevent disturbing behaviors before they occur.  Survey results indicated that field staff already engage in proactive actions despite not being trained extensively to do so.  In addition, staff held substantially more positive evaluative beliefs about proactive interactions than reactive interactions.  Rather than identifying problems confronting the CWP, these results identify opportunities that can be built on to improve the program.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-26T19:37:40Z (GMT).

Browsing by these herbivores can influence patterns of forest regeneration following a timber harvest.  Logging debris, or ?slash?, has the potential to inhibit deer browsing and enhance forest regeneration in a cutover area.  At two heavily logged sites in the Arnot Forest, NY, study plots containing experimental seedlings and natural vegetation were created in May 2004 and monitored thru November 2006.  Each plot received one of three treatments: open - cleared of logging debris; tops ? tree tops and debris-covered; or fenced - cleared of debris and fenced to exclude deer.  Levels of deer browsing in experimental seedlings and natural vegetation, tree seedling growth, and natural vegetation richness, were compared among these treatments.  We found significantly higher deer browsing on experimental seedlings (p = .0053) and palatable herbaceous vegetation (p = .0094) in open plots, than tops-covered or fenced plots.  Cumulative deer browsing negatively correlated with mean experimental seedling height at the plot level (p = .0296), resulting in higher black cherry (Prunus serotina) seedling growth in protected fenced and tops treatments.  Additionally, logging debris was found to benefit common management objectives, such as herb richness and relative abundance of desirable timber tree seedlings. We conclude that logging debris left in place after a forest thinning can effectively inhibit deer browsing and promote forest regeneration. The degree of protection afforded by tree tops was intermediate between unprotected and fenced areas.  The minimal effort and cost associated with this technique would make it highly preferable to constructing fences to improve regeneration. As white-tailed deer become increasingly overabundant, alternative options for the sustainable regeneration of forests are necessary; the post-harvest retention of logging debris in situ provides such an alternative.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-26T19:45:49Z (GMT).

At birth, the newborn is well endowed with iron stores, which are adequate to meet his/her needs for the first 4-6 months of infancy (WHO March 2001), and iron deficiency is rare. On the other hand, iron deficiency is prevalent among infants between 6- 12 months of age, particularly in developing countries, and iron supplementation during breastfeeding, and thereafter, is recommended, in addition to 6 months exclusive breastfeeding (WHO, 2002). If exclusively breastfed infants are becoming anemic by the time complementary foods are first being introduced, this raises a challenge to our assumptions about the nature of human bio-cultural evolution. Is the anemia of infancy normal or did usual feeding practices prevent it? As iron supplementation was not possible until recently, I hypothesized that exclusive breastfeeding was complemented by premasticated foods during our evolution as a hunting-gathering species. In other words, that iron deficiency in infancy is a recent problem in human society, which was previously prevented by premastication. 

 The goals of this research were to assess the prevalence of premastication in non-modern societies in order to determine whether (1) it was prevalent enough to support plausibly its role as a behavioral adaptation to prevent iron deficiency and  (2) to determine whether the potentially detrimental effects of premasticated food were harmful enough to be selected against. This research involves several lines of investigation: 1) bringing together the evidence that iron deficiency is a common problem, which is now found in many different regions of the world, 2) a cross-cultural study, using the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) to obtain ethnographic data on the distribution and time depth of premastication in human societies, 3) a field research study in China, based on interviews conducted by University students, to examine the potential for serious under-reporting of pre-mastication in the ethnographic studies, 4)  a review of the iron content of foods that are reported to be premasticated, and  5) a review of the scientific literature on the content of saliva. 

In the HRAF analysis, 39 cultures out of 119 cultures (33%) that contain any information on infant feeding describe premastication as an infant feeding practice. Notably none of the ethnographies from China mention premastication. However, the field survey in China, with a sample of 104 elite college students, found that 63%  (65 of 104) were fed pre-masticated food when they were infants, and those who received premasticated foods were more likely to be fed complementary foods earlier than those who did not. The survey findings support the notion that premastication tends to be under-reported in ethnographic studies. Although salvia has not been as extensively studied as breastmilk, the review of the biomedical literature suggests that it contains several potential positive substances from the perspective of infant health and fewer negative substances than are commonly assumed. 

The results of the various lines of investigation suggest that pre-mastication has been a common practice in human societies, but has been significantly under-reported. 
The potential dangers of increased infection that pre-mastication poses for infant health  
have probably been less serious  than the disadvantages of not engaging in pre-mastication, which is a means of giving infants iron to prevent deficiency as stores begin to drop during the first semester of life. Therefore I conclude it is probable that pre-mastication was the behavior/cultural solution to the complementary feeding challenge in human societies, that it probably prevented the level of iron deficiency, which is common today in poor societies.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-26T20:03:36Z (GMT).

Current shelf-stable concentrated dairy products often have brown off-colors and ?cooked? off-flavors due to heat-induced Maillard browning and whey protein denaturation that occur during sterilization.  

MF was used in this study to develop a novel concentrated milk product depleted of most of its lactose (to limit Maillard browning) and whey proteins.  Acidified skim milk was concentrated to 8x microfiltration concentration factor and then diluted 1:1 with distilled water and sterilized in cans to produce a microfiltered milk concentrate (MMC). 

The MMC was characterized by its chemical composition, color, apparent viscosity, flow behavior, and storage potential.  Furthermore, these characteristics of the MMC were compared with a concentrated dairy product, commercial evaporated milk (CEM).

It was comparable to CEM in total solids, greater in true protein, casein, and fat, and lower in ash, lactose and whey proteins.  The MMC retained much more of the white color of HTST-pasteurized milk than the CEM.  The apparent viscosity (~9.5 cP at 30?C) of the MMC was much greater than that of the CEM and the MMC was seen to be more

The lineage III isolates represent three previously identified lineage III subsets known as lineage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. 

Evolutionary analysis identified intragenic positive selection in actA and plcA, and intergenic positive selection in the non-coding regions flanking hly. Positive selection in actA occurred in many positions previously recognized for their interactions with proteins involved in actin tail polymerization. Also, one positively selected site upstream of hly was located in its -35 promoter region. Additionally, horizontal gene transfer was recognized in actA, plcB, and mpl. The majority of events involved actA fragments transferred between lineages IIIA and II. Lineage IIIB did not partipate in any inter-lineage recombination events, but may have donated an mpl fragment to lineage IIIC. Neighbor joining phylogenies suggest that lineage III subsets IIIA and IIIC are monophyletic with lineage I, but that lineage IIIB is not. Therefore, due to its lack of horizontal gene transfer, and distant phylogenetic relationship to the rest of L. monocytogenes, lineage IIIB may represent a distinct subspecies.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-26T20:20:08Z (GMT).

During winter, the borders between these two land use types become especially interesting as winds moving across fields entrain fallen snow and may redistribute it to the forest edge. Since snow depth can have serious implications for soil conditions and biogeochemical processes, I proposed to evaluate snow distribution at field- forest boundaries in Tompkins County, NY through a combination of techniques that address the degree of snow redistribution at a variety of scales.  Continuous measures using time-lapse photographs taken along a field border from January to March 2007 were used to assess localized redistribution over a snow period. These observations revealed snow accumulation at the field-forest border particularly in areas where the grass in the field had been mowed. Manual measurements of snow depth across several field- forest borders throughout the county were used to estimate how much snow was redistributed to borders, on average, in the county. These data demonstrated that there are a number of factors affecting the extent of snow redistribution from fields to forest borders, but the phenomenon definitely exists. A rough extrapolation of our results suggests that 1.9% of Tompkins County?s snow accumulates at these boundaries (which comprise 1.3% of the county?s area).  With the increasing fragmentation of landscapes, it is integral to understand physical processes such as snow drifting at forest edges so that we can then better comprehend the ecological implications of such occurrences.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-26T20:24:36Z (GMT).

This area, known colloquially by forecasters as the ?hurricane graveyard,? is located within the belt of tropical easterlies during most of the Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts from June through November.  Tropical easterly waves emerging from the African continent usually follow a path through the Lesser Antilles and into the eastern Caribbean.  GOES infrared satellite imagery shows that easterly waves frequently exhibit warming cloud tops and decreasing convection in an area bounded by the islands to the north and east, Venezuela to the south, and roughly 75 degrees longitude to the west.  QuikSCAT derived surface winds during clear-sky conditions frequently show the presence of accelerating easterlies in the central Caribbean as part of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ).  Analysis of the NCEP global reanalysis wind fields suggests the presence of an area of persistent low-level mass divergence in the eastern Caribbean.  This implies a subsident regime that would weaken convection.  Climatologically, this phenomenon reaches peak intensity in July, then shifts towards the east and weakens in the latter half of the Atlantic hurricane season.  This is reflected by the local minimum of tropical cyclogenesis points in the National Hurricane Center?s best track data in the early part of the season.  El Ni?o directly affects the strength of the CLLJ, and hence, is related to the intensity of the low-level divergence in the eastern Caribbean.  The local minimum of tropical cyclogenesis in this region has important implications to operational forecasting, since the vast majority of tropical cyclones in the Caribbean eventually affect surrounding landmasses.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-27T12:47:45Z (GMT).

However, sub-Saharan Africa is distant from major food export markets, and many of its countries are landlocked.  In my research, I quantify the influence of the region?s transport-prohibitive characteristics on food security. By constructing regression models from agricultural trade data, I demonstrate that geographically isolated countries face substantially higher grain import prices, and these higher prices can raise the prevalence of hunger.   I find that 300 kilometers between the port of disembarkation and the major population agglomeration in the importing country explains a one percentage point increase in the undernourished population.    This result highlights the needs for infrastructure investment and low trade barriers to minimize the cost of remoteness and promote the eradication of hunger in the region.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-27T14:02:46Z (GMT).

It is important to ascertain whether the quarterlife experience is salient across national boundaries, and whether it has a similar impact on the expectations of young adults in various cultural contexts.  Cross-cultural findings could yield valuable data for policy-makers or employers aiming to attract or retain young adults within a specific region.  To explore the universality of quarterlife transition, I compare the expected geographic mobility of college students preparing to graduate in two different regions: Flanders, Belgium, which is characterized by retention of young adults, and upstate New York, which has seen immense out-migration of young adults in recent decades.  Interviews conducted with graduating college students in both locales provide a foundation of qualitative data.  To understand the personal allegories and stories that individuals shared with me, I apply an analytical thematic framework rooted in sociological life-course theory.  Life-Span Development, Agency, Time and Place, Timing, Linked Lives comprise the five paradigmatic principles used to create a comparison of young adults in Flanders and upstate New York.

However, a recent study conducted shows that physicians do not know how to diagnose prediabetes. This current investigation explores the spread of prediabetes information through the perspective of the diffusion of innovation theory.  Methods. A secondary analysis of the physician assessment on diabetes knowledge established the problem.  A follow-up survey was distributed to physicians to explore the effectiveness of communication sources.  Results. The presence of barriers to information is associated with less time researching a topic. The most frequently used medium is internet, and the more sources that are used when researching the topic is correlated to a higher perception of knowledge on prediabetes.  A physician will attend an information session run by a physician that he admires regardless of the topic. Conclusion. A secondary analysis established that physicians are not correctly diagnosing prediabetes.  The follow-up survey suggests confirmation of three hypotheses, hypotheses: (1) physicians are less likely to spend time researching a topic when a barrier is present, even if they perceive ease in accessing medical information, (2) physicians who use more information sources perceive that they are more informed, and that  the internet is the most effective medium when researching medical information, and (3) physicians are more likely to attend an information session run by a physician they admire, regardless of the topic.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-27T15:08:53Z (GMT).

Fifty freshmen attended a session at the Human Metabolic Unit and answered two questionnaires:  The Eating Habits Questionnaire and Power Food Scale, and body weight was measured.  They were served an all-you-can-eat lunch of pasta, marinara sauce, salad, dressing, and soup.  Food intake was measured and recorded.  After two weeks, the subjects attended a restaurant-style lunch and were served 1.5 times what they ate at lunch one.  When subjects finished eating, they were offered an all-you-can-eat dessert of chocolate cake and ice cream.  Again food intake was measured and recorded.  Change in food intake across lunches was determined.  At the end of the semester, subjects were weighed again to determine body weight change.
The evidence all in, the conclusion is inescapable:  restrained eaters are more responsive to environmental cues and have higher food power scores.  In this study, eating restraint was an accurate predictor of food intake and the more restrained eaters ate significantly more when served more food and when served dessert compared to less restrained eaters.  A significant freshman weight gain of approximately two pounds was also determined, but the association between restraint and weight gain was not significant.  This study should be tweaked and replicated so that the relationship between dietary restraint, consumption, and freshman weight gain can be understood.  With the appropriate data available, policy changes can be made to implement changes on college campuses that will help combat disordered eating patterns that are characteristic of restrained eaters.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-27T15:13:24Z (GMT).

In this study, we focused on the adrenal medulla, which is a critical component of the neuroendocrine system and responsible for modulating reactions to stress and regulation of various body processes including digestion, the immune system, mood, and energy usage. Secretion of epinephrine (EPI) from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla is tightly controlled by the electrophysiologial response generated from neural inputs. Several studies suggest that the intrinsic excitability of these cells is modulated by the number and kenetic properties of large-conductance calcium(2+)-activated potassium ion channels (BK channels). Therefore, we focused on BK channels to study strain- and gender-specific differences in the adrenal gland at the level of ion channels. Stress- and sex-steroids have been shown to regulate alternative splicing of the pore-forming subunit of BK channels (Slo-?) in several experimental contexts, and associated ?-subunits confer on BK channels distinct sensitivities to acute effects of stress- and sex-steroids. Using a real-time PCR technique, we examined mRNA levels for total Slo, STREX (a stress-regulated splice-variant of Slo), ?2, and ?4 in two mouse strains, SJL and C57/BL6. The experimental groups were: SJL males, SJL females, and C57/BL6 males. SJL males expressed significantly higher levels of mRNA for total Slo, ?2, and ?4 than SJL females and C57/BL6 males. STREX levels were not significantly different between the groups, probably due to a small sample size, but on average, SJL males had higher levels of expression than the other two groups. These results suggest that SJL females and C57/BL6 males are relatively similar in their BK channel expression in the adrenals, while SJL males show distinct expression patterns. From this study, we now have grounds for hypothesizing functional relationships between behavior and adrenal function.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-27T15:26:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We sampled 159 manakins from nine forest fragments of varying size and isolation within an 18 kilometer radius, and genotyped these birds at 13 microsatellite loci. Bayesian clustering methods revealed that birds from all fragments comprised a single genetic population, and F-statistics showed only modest levels of differentiation between forest patches. We calculated allelic diversity indices for each fragment but found no correlation between genetic diversity and fragment size. These results suggest two possibilities: first, these manakins may retain substantial connectivity via inter-fragment dispersal despite habitat fragmentation, or if dispersal is currently limited, the short period of a half-century since fragmentation may not have been sufficient to impose genetic structuring or to erode allelic diversity.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-28T20:22:59Z (GMT).

It has been found through bioinformatic analysis of MHC class I sequences of horses of different haplotypes that classical MHC class I alleles commonly fall within four loci, with additional individual genes that do not fit within any of the four loci.  Conserved regions of horse and donkey MHC class I sequences were used to design PCR primers that amplified donkey class I genes.  RT-PCR reactions were carried out on donkey lymphocyte cDNA.  The MEGA 3 program was used to cluster related sequences and to assign them to individual loci.  Donkey sequences followed a similar pattern to that of the horse, having a few loci that contain many of the alleles and additional MHC class I loci that may be unique to one or only a few MHC haplotypes. The donkey alleles fell into either previously established horse loci or loci unique to donkeys.  Loci shared between horses and donkeys are probably older loci, having evolved before the split of hoses and donkeys, while loci detected in only one species may be younger.  Comparing the allelic variation between horses and donkeys will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the highly variant MHC region.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-28T20:26:51Z (GMT).

Recent evidence suggests that they may also be able to utilize vitamin A2 under both natural conditions and after treatment with thyroxine.  To test for the presence of vitamin A2 in the retinae of zebrafish and map its location, I combined microspectrophotometric (MSP) analysis with 2D-imaging.  MSP measures the absorbance spectra of visual pigments within single photoreceptors, while 2D-imaging uses differential bleaching to attempt differentiation of those regions rich in A1 pigment from those containing A2. Previous MSP has found the occasional A2 cell in some fish, but failed to demonstrate a specific area or island utilizing the A2 chromophore in zebrafish, possibly due to sampling problems of the MSP technique.  Unfortunately, the 2D-imaging failed to show enough contrast between bleached and unbleached retinal regions to determine if, in fact, bleaching occurred at all.  
In an attempt to enrich the retina in vitamin A2, thyroxine treated eyecup cultures were used.  In this case the hope was to stimulate A2 synthesis in cultured eyecup preparations.  MSP was used to monitor changes in vitamin A2-based pigment.  There was a failure to observe A2 synthesis in culture.

This study was undertaken to identify at least one receptor for BSP-30-kDa on the oviductal epithelium. Proteins extracted from apical plasma membranes of the oviductal epithelium were added to a column of BSP-30-kDa bound to anti-BSP-30-kDa covalently conjugated to Protein-A agarose beads. Unbound proteins were washed from the beads and proteins that bound to the column were eluted by adding EGTA, a calcium chelator, because sperm binding to the oviductal epithelium is dependent on calcium. The eluates were resolved on SDS PAGE gels, and silver staining detected two prominent bands of approximately 37 and 34 kDa. Tandem mass spectrometry identified the protein constituents of the bands as annexins (ANXA) 1, 2, and 4. Anti-annexin antibodies also labeled the cilia and apical surfaces of the epithelium in sections of bovine oviduct. Annexins belong to a multigene family of calcium-dependent, phospholipid binding proteins. Annexins are important in several biological processes such as cell adhesion, ion channel modulation, signal transduction, and regulation of membrane structure.

After measuring a control rate of fluid secretion, aedeskinin III was added to the peritubular Ringer solution.  Rates of transepithelial fluid secretion significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner at aedeskinin concentrations ranging from 10-5 to 10-9M.  Maximal stimulatory effects were observed at 1 ?M aedeskinin III, which increased the fluid secretion rate from 0.667 to 1.451 nl/min.  EC50 for aedeskinin III was calculated as 1.028x10-7M.  In the presence of 1 ?M aedeskinin III, the Na+ concentration in secreted fluid significantly decreased from 130.5 to 88.2 mM and the Cl- concentration in secreted fluid significantly decreased from 208.6 to 173.5 mM.  The increase in the K+ concentration from 82.1 mM to 90.3 mM was not significant.  The product of the fluid secretion rate and electrolyte secretion yields the electrolyte secretion rate.  Accordingly, the transepithelial secretion rate for Na+ increased from 96.3 pmols/min to 127.6 pmols/min, the K+ secretion rate increased from 61.6 pmols/min to 141.2 pmols/min, and the Cl- secretion rate increased from 153.9 to 257.5 pmols/min.  However, only the effects on K+ and Cl- secretion were statistically significant.

In late June of 2006, heavy rains flooded over 120 common tern (Sterna hirundo) nests, causing a re-nesting effort of over 140 pairs, and perhaps one case of double-brooding.  To evaluate the level of parental effort after a late-season flooding event, I weighed and then compared the eggs of the second clutches to corresponding egg data from the first clutches of 1983 and 1984 from the same colony on Oneida Lake, NY.  The mean egg weights from the second clutch of 2006 all weighed significantly less than the corresponding mean egg weights of the first clutches of 1983 and 1984.  In both first and second clutches, there was a linear decrease in egg weight with laying order.  Three hypotheses have been postulated to explain the intraclutch variation of egg weights, the ?brood-survival?, ?brood-reduction?, and ?insurance? hypotheses attempt.  Given the circumstances of 2006, the brood-reduction hypothesis fits best at explaining the intraclutch variation in egg weights.
The observed decline in parental effort late in the season can be explained by the ?timing? hypothesis, which in the case of this study included a decreased food supply and reduced breeding synchrony later in the season.  Certain aspects of the life history of common terns such as molt, which overlapped with the production of the second clutch, as well as the allocation of energy between parents in a bi-parental care system, also decreased the success of many second clutches.  Many adults associated with second clutch nests abandoned their eggs and/or chicks in order to enhance the probability of their own survival.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T13:42:11Z (GMT).

It is characterized by an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a phox homology (PX) domain, and a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology (BAR) domain. Together with clathrin and dynamin, it functions mainly in the endocytic pathway to sort proteins. SNX9 has also been shown to regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by its interaction with Activated Cdc42-associated kinase-2 (ACK2), thus implicating a role for SNX9 in signal transduction.
	Although the main cellular functions of SNX9 have been brought to light, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which this multi-domain protein participates in endocytosis and signaling. It is also unclear if and how the protein is regulated. In order to understand the interactions between the various domains of SNX9, we have crystallized and solved the structure of a shorter construct of SNX9 (here after called SNX9PX-BAR), which consists of only the PX and BAR domains. By analyzing this multi-domain structure and by conducting lipid- and vesicle-binding assays, we are able to gain a better understanding of how the two domains interact to influence the membrane binding ability of SNX9. 
	Our analysis of the structure of SNX9PX-BAR shows a dimeric BAR domain that is moderately curved. The BAR domain forms stable dimers via mainly hydrophobic interactions on the membrane surface. Membrane binding is most likely driven by electrostatic interactions between the PX-BAR domain and the negatively-charged plasma membrane. In addition, the PX domain of SNX9 shows high and specific binding affinity to PI(3)P, which is in high concentrations in early endosomes. Therefore, we propose that SNX9 might be localized to both the plasma membrane and the early endosomes to participate in endocytosis and sorting of vesicles.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T14:09:49Z (GMT).

Fin whales have three different sounds in their vocal repertoire but a relatively simple song that is composed of long trains of high intensity 20-Hz pulses.  Performed only by males, the song may be a reproductive display with song characteristics evolutionarily fixed within populations.  In this study, fin whale vocalizations recorded in the area of Cape Cod Bay during the years 1961, 1978, 2001, and 2005 were characterized and compared within years to detect possible divergence in the male song.  Reliable comparisons with the earlier data proved difficult because of small sample sizes under the chosen song parameters.  However, measurements of inter-pulse interval and song length did vary significantly between the short time span of 2001 to 2005.  Mean inter-pulse intervals were shorter in 2001, and song duration was longer within the 2005 recordings.  Negative correlations between the center frequency and the song duration, as well as the center frequency and inter-pulse interval were also found.  Although we rejected the null hypothesis that song notes and features are fixed and do not change over time, we did discover valuable information regarding the relationships between different features of fin whale song.  Based on comparison of the temporal and individual variation observed in our data with those collected on a population in Bermuda, it is unclear whether vocal characteristics are distinct and could be an identifying feature of separate breeding populations.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T14:17:23Z (GMT).

High water level may inhibit seedling establishment, but not adult growth, thus suggesting a potential ontogenetic expansion of flooding tolerance. We conducted greenhouse flooding experiments on seedlings and adults of various sizes with three treatments: high flood (a percentage of aboveground biomass submerged), waterlogged (only root systems submerged), and control (no flooding). The effect of initial height above water and treatment on relative growth rate was significant for the seedlings: RGR decreased with increasing flood level; however, there was no significant effect for adults. Seedlings were more negatively affected by flooding than adults due primarily to their small size rather than any differences in ability to produce flood responses (i.e., enlarged lenticels or adventitious roots). Additionally, we conducted seed experiments investigating the effects of different substrates and durations of flooding on germination success; there were no significant effects of either factor on seed germination. This study increases our understanding of regeneration biology and can be valuable in planning restoration activities in cypress-tupelo swamps.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T14:38:44Z (GMT).

Why isn?t Carcinus most abundant where prey densities are highest? A previous experiment revealed a higher mortality rate for Carcinus tethered in the subtidal than in the intertidal.

Lobsters were the more effective predator on Carcinus, consuming 27% of the crabs during 24 hours. Only 5% of Carcinus were eaten by C. borealis and none by conspecifics used in control treatments. In the presence of lobsters, Carcinus showed significantly more climbing and deep burrowing behavior relative to controls.

Pools were monitored for temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, water color and clarity, and presence or absence of key macrofauna. The color and clarity of pools, which we used as a proxy for phytoplankton levels, varied throughout the summer and ranged between being always opaque to always clear, or cycling between these two states.  Cycling of pools is important for the macrofauna because it indicates varying conditions that organisms must contend with.  Clear pools had significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels, pH values and presumably, based on water clarity, lower phytoplankton stocks, while opaque pools had higher levels of both dissolved oxygen and pH and usually very high phytoplankton levels.  Diel vertical migration by Daphnia. pulex was observed in these island pools which is interesting because of the lack of vertebrate predators.  Significantly higher densities of D. pulex occurred in the top 10cm during the night than day.  With the absence of significant predators, physical or genetic factors must explain the observed migration to the surface at night by D. pulex.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T15:14:17Z (GMT).

Although it is known that the presence of a virus in the host plant can lead to a change in feeding behavior and an increase in fecundity (Fereres et al. 1990, Fereres et al. 1989, Montllor and Gildow 1986), there is little evidence that vectors prefer infected hosts over uninfected hosts.

The eight grass species used in the preference tests are commonly found in New York State and are known hosts of BYDV.  Preference tests were carried out in cages, where adult aphids were allowed to choose among grass seedlings.  To determine whether infection altered preference, aphids were offered either uninfected grass communities or communities that contained a mixture of infected and uninfected grass seedlings.  Results from these trials indicated strong species-specific preferences by aphids for particular grasses.  Although there was some indication that infection could alter preference, I found no evidence that infection caused a significant shift in preference ranking among grasses.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T15:18:47Z (GMT).

It was also shown that the Us3 protein is involved in actin stress fiber breakdown. In this study we constructed a recombinant virus (Us3*220A) to determine the significance of the Us3 kinase activity.

In the present study, leatherback turtle eggshells were collected from 21 different nests on the nesting beach in Jamursba Medi, Papua, Indonesia in the Western Pacific in July 2003.

Comparing these values with the ?15N values of habitat samples analyzed in this study and others as well as with information on Pacific-wide nitrogen fixation/denitrification patterns, suggests that these two ?15N groupings represent animals foraging in the Western Pacific and Eastern Pacific, respectively.

The stimuli were presented in random order three time each in vapor-phase either retronasally or oral-cavity-only. They were identified on a digital computer by 20 subjects (ages 18 to 35, 9 females). Retronasal presentations were produced by inhaling via the mouth with a nose clip closing the nostrils, and then removing the nose clip and exhaling from the nose. Oral-cavity-only presentations were produced by inhalation via the mouth with a nose clip closing the nostrils, and exhalation from the mouth with the nose clip remaining in place.

RESULTS: Median percent retronasal correct identifications [correct identification terms are shown in brackets] were: eugenol, 100% [cloves or spice]; heptyl alcohol, 67% [cleaner]; nonanal, 58% [citrus or floral]; 1-octanol, 71% [citrus or cleaner]; dl-menthol, 100% [ointment or peppermint]; valeric acid, 67% [rancid or sweat].   Median percent correct oral-cavity-only identifications were all 0%, except for dl-menthol, for which percent correct oral-cavity-only median correct identification was 67%. A Friedman Non-Parametric ANOVA statistical analysis showed significant difference between odorants presented oral-cavity-only versus retronasal. Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between odorants presented oral-cavity-only versus retronasal for all odorants except for dl-menthol. CONCLUSIONS: Many vapor-phase 'trigeminal' odorants can be identified only when access to the nasal cavity (retronasal) occurs, but substantial correct identification of vapor-phase dl-menthol also occurs when restricted to the oral cavity (oral-cavity-only).  Odorants similar to dl-menthol may contribute to flavor from both the oral and nasal cavities.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T16:02:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Nest lining is known to be an important factor in Tree Swallow reproductive success, but competition for feathers has never been experimentally studied despite the fact that acrobatic aerial competitions for feathers are frequent and easily observable.  To examine the proximate and ultimate causes of feather contests, I manipulated the nest-lining of breeding swallows and then observed individual behaviors throughout the breeding season.  Both males and females gathered feathers, beginning with nest construction and continuing through chick rearing.  It is clear that there are two distinct methods of feather gathering: feather ?collection,? an early-season behavior characterized by a lack of interaction with other birds, and feather ?contests,? conspicuous, aggressive interactions involving several birds.  Contests over larger feathers were more intense than those over smaller feathers.  Early-season contest winners tended to exhibit drop-catch displays with the feather, had well-feathered nests, and were ultimately reproductively successful; there is some evidence that these contest winners may be higher quality individuals.  The number of feathers in the nest at the time of a contest was also an important determinant of behavior.  A late-season individual with a well-feathered nest tended to participate less in contests and drop the feather more frequently.  The associations and feedbacks among contest performance, individual quality, the number of feathers in the nest, and reproductive success indicate that feather contests involve complex behaviors that are highly variable among individuals and change in response to varying conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T16:13:31Z (GMT).

The horse was used as a model organism, and the experiments were performed on normal equine chondrocytes cultured   in   vitro.  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are known to have catabolic effects on the cartilage matrix while osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) is a known anabolic factor.  There is no complimentary information regarding the effects of these peptides on small G-protein (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) activation in articular chondrocytes. The objectives of the present study were to determine the activation status of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho after treatment with IL-6, IL-8, or OP-1.  The G-proteins play an important role in the maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton and chondrocyte phenotype, so they are of interest because of their clinical relevance in regards to osteoarthritis.  To determine a suitable dose for use in these activation assays, chondrocytes were treated in vitro with varying concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, or OP-1, and changes in RNA transcripts of MMP-3, MMP-13, Col2A1, and Aggrecan were quantified using RT-PCR.  In the case of IL-6, IL-8, and OP-1, it was determined that a dose of 100ng/mL media stimulated catabolism/anabolism. Chondrocytes were also examined using confocal microscopy following treatment with IL-6, IL-8, or OP-1 to determine if a correlation exists between the normal vs fibroblastic phenotypes and the activation status of the small G-proteins.  
Our initial hypothesis was that IL-6 and IL-8 would increase Cdc42 and Rac and decrease Rho activity, while OP-1 would have an opposite effect.  Activity of the small G-proteins was determined through an affinity binding assay and subsequent western analysis.  To date, our experiments indicate that treatment of the chondrocytes with IL-6 and IL-8 resulted in a decreased activity status of Cdc42 and Rac, which is contrary to the initial hypothesis.  Studies to determine the effects of OP-1 and the activation status of Rho in response to all treatments are nearing completion.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-06-29T16:27:13Z (GMT).

OA involves the degradation of articular cartilage, which functions to dissipate tensile forces and cushion the joint1. Cartilage degeneration in OA is the result of multiple events including enzymatic degradation of matrix components and malfunction of the intracellular signaling pathways in chondrocytes 2. Traditionally, the catabolic cytokine interlukin-1, also called catabolin, has been used to induce an OA phenotype for in vitro experiments3, 4. Recent studies, however, indicate that matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), also termed collagenase-3, is chiefly responsible for cartilage deterioration2, 4, 5. Though MMP-13 has been shown to play an integral role in OA, most studies to date have focused on proteoglycan cleavage mechanisms and the characterization of MMP-13 cell-surface binding and internalization 2, 3, 6-9. Thus it is the broad objective of this Honors Research Project to determine the effects of equine MMP-13 on the matrix molecule expression of chondrocytes and on the activation states of the small G-proteins of the Rho family (Cdc42, Rac, RhoA), and compare the results to those achieved after treatment with IL-1. To accomplish these aims, equine recombinant MMP-13 (eqrMMP-13) was cloned, inserted into a protein expression vector, and expressed as the active enzyme. To evaluate the expression of extracellular matrix molecules, chondrocytes were plated in monolayer, treated with eqrMMP-13, and total RNA was extracted and evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. Assessment of the effect of MMP-13 GTPase activation was accomplished by treating chondrocytes in monolayer, retaining active GTP-bound GTPases from cell lysates using a GST fusion protein containing the binding domain of a down-stream target, in pull-down assays, and analyzing the retained proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western analysis, in addition to confocal microscopy. This study showed that MMP-13 induced similar changes in matrix molecule expression as IL-1 and significantly upregulated gene expression of the catabolic factor MMP-3, while down regulating gene expression of the anabolic factor collagen II B (Col2A1). Preliminary data from the pull-down assays indicate that IL-1 and MMP-13 decrease the activation status of Rac, and increase the activation status of RhoA. Confocal microscopy images support these findings. Together the results of this study suggest utilizing MMP-13 to induce the OA phenotype is an acceptable model of cartilage degradation in vitro. This may better mimic the native articular environment, and lead to more clinically translatable results than studies using IL-1 chondrocyte cultures.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-05T16:05:34Z (GMT).

Multiple mutations leading to premature stop codons (PMSCs) have been identified in the key L. monocytogenes virulence gene inlA, which codes for a surface protein that mediates the entry of L. monocytogenes into host cells. Mutations leading to premature stop codons in inlA are associated with a reduced invasion phenotype in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that these mutations may also be responsible for attenuated human virulence. In order to further define the frequency of L. monocytogenes strains with reduced invasion capability, 207 isolates had previously been screened for ability to invade Caco-2 cells (Nightingale, unpublished). The inlA gene was sequenced for 27 isolates that showed attenuated ability to invade the epithelial cell line. Sequencing revealed mutations leading to PMSCs in 12 of the 27 isolates, including 2 novel mutations (PMSC types 5 and 7) and 3 previously reported mutations (PMSC types 1, 4 and 6). All but one of the isolates with confirmed PMSC mutations in inlA were isolated from food products or food processing plants. Our data support the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes isolates associated with food have attenuated invasion due to the presence of inlA PMSCs. Our data further suggest that sequence variation in inlA is an important factor that can be used to define L. monocytogenes that have a reduced ability to cause human disease. Since some strains with PMSCs in inlA were common in foods and environmental samples and were found in high levels in foods, it was hypothesized that these mutations may provide selective advantage, possibly outside a human host. Isogenic inlA PMSC strains were thus tested for their growth in rich medium and their resistance against common sanitizing agents. The results indicate that there is little difference in growth trends or sanitizer resistance between isogenic strains with and without inlA PMSC. It thus appears that inlA PMSCs do not enhance the ability of L. monocytogenes to grow in rich media or to be resistant to sanitizing agents.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-05T16:13:45Z (GMT).

Almost all individuals with DS also experience an early onset of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and show similar cognitive and learning deficits. There are currently no treatments for these deficits in DS. However, choline availability during the perinatal period has shown to have long-term benefits on memory and attentional function. This study utilized a series of attentional tests that evaluated the benefits of perinatal choline treatment in Ts65Dn mice, an animal model of Down syndrome. Specifically, we used the ?Surprising Reward Omission? (SRO) Task in which an expected reward is omitted on 20% of the correct responses, to test attentional dysfunction and heightened error reactivity in these mice. Since previous SRO studies with Ts65Dn mice have shown an increase in locomotor activity and stereotypic behaviors such as jumping and grooming following reward omission, we supplemented our findings on overall performance with an analysis of video data. We hypothesized that the Ts65Dn mice will exhibit an exaggerated response to the omission of an expected reward relative to controls, which will be reflected by their poor performance on the SRO task, and that choline treatment will alleviate these dysfunctions. Our results indicated that the unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice had significant attentional dysfunction and reacted to incorrect responses with increased activity level. These abnormalities in Ts65Dn mice were normalized by perinatal choline supplementation. The reward omission did not significantly affect the performance of any of the mice (in terms of correct responses). Yet the elevated alcove latencies and omission errors in unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice provided some indication of increased reaction to reward omission. We expect the behavioral video analysis (in progress) to elucidate the exact nature of these reactions and the effect of choline treatment on arousal regulation and subsequent behaviors in Ts65Dn mice.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-05T16:18:17Z (GMT).

Recently, during a screen utilizing the ether-a- go-go (eag) Shaker (Sh) double mutant to identify genes that affect oxidative stress sensitivity, we uncovered a lethal interaction between gain-of-function esg mutations and the eag Sh double mutant The eag and Sh genes encode potassium channel subunits; epilepsy studies have revealed that eag and Sh are also mild seizure suppressors (Kuebler et al. 2001). The esg gene interaction is thus of great interest as it rescues seizure prone mutations while causing lethality in animals with increased seizure resistance. This study investigates the lethal interaction between eag Sh and esg to better understand its underlying mechanisms. Our results indicate that lethality is caused by severely impaired motor control in the adult. The animal exhibits many adult specific phenotypes, with distinctive synaptic phenotypes in adult and larvae. These results suggest that the critical period for esg-induced lethality is during adult development which agrees with the results of epilepsy studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-06T13:12:20Z (GMT).

This information will give us a more detailed picture of the processes of meiosis and spermatogenesis, not just in the mouse but in all organisms with homologous genes and mechanisms.

I used bioinformatics to pinpoint genes which were being directly affected by A-myb using microarray data from 14 and 17 day wild-type and mutant testes. In addition, antibody staining for A-MYB protein was much lower in mutant mice, suggesting protein destabilization in mutants. Several differences in histone composition were observed through antibody staining. Expression of genes that seemed to be affected in the microarray were studied using real-time PCR to determine if they have overlapping roles in spermatogenesis.

The mutation in A-Myb affected many genes, most of which became downregulated. These affected genes may be transcribed by A-Myb directly or may be affected indirectly through expression of mediating genes. As more data is collected, we will be able to construct a model of A-Myb?s function in spermatogenesis and understand which genes play key roles in meiosis and spermatogenesis.

Ultimately, knowledge of the inner workings of meiosis and spermatogenesis will allow for advances in human and veterinary medicine. This knowledge is especially applicable to males who are sterile.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-06T13:32:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Because IFN-y is an antigen-induced protein produced by blood lymphocytes, namely CD4+ T-cells, it is considered the first and foremost form of defense that the host has against infections. Two pathogens that induce a cell mediated immune response (CMI) are Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which causes tuberculosis (TB), and Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (Map), which is the causative agent for Johne's disease. Both diseases pose serious health and economic problems for livestock production, particularly cattle. Clinical signs of these diseases are not apparent during the early stages of infection nor are the levels of the mycobacterium high enough to detect. However, since exposure to tuberculin or Johnin antigen by skin testing induces a pathogen-specific CMI response with increased IFN-y, it has been suggested that this assay, in combination, might be useful in the diagnosis of TB or Johne's. However, while IFN-y assays are available, they have qualities that prohibit their routine use in the field. In this study, we report the construction and optimization of a lateral flow assay for determining levels of IFN-y. This assay is also robust, easy-to-use and requires no sophisticated equipment, all qualities that are required for field performance. The format of the assay involves the immobilization of an IFN-y capture antibody onto plastic-backed nitrocellulose membrane using inkjet deposition. Then the sample is allowed to wick vertically up the membrane. Reagents to detect bound IFN-y are then wicked up the membrane and the printed lines of the capture antibody binding IFN-y antigen are developed. Thus far, this assay is sensitive to 1ng/ml IFN-y. When used in combination with skin testing, this IFN-y assay may prove useful in the diagnosis of early mycobacterium infection, and potentially other infections that induce a CMI response.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-06T14:21:28Z (GMT).

It is characterized by an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a phox homology (PX) domain, and a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology (BAR) domain. Together with clathrin and dynamin, it functions mainly in the endocytic pathway to sort proteins. SNX9 has also been shown to regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by its interaction with Activated Cdc42-associated kinase-2 (ACK2), thus implicating a role for SNX9 in signal transduction.

Although the main cellular functions of SNX9 have been brought to light, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which this multi-domain protein participates in endocytosis and signaling. It is also unclear if and how the protein is regulated. In order to understand the interactions between the various domains of SNX9, we have crystallized and solved the structure of a shorter construct of SNX9 (here after called SNX9PX-BAR), which consists of only the PX and BAR domains. By analyzing this multi-domain structure and by conducting lipid- and vesicle-binding assays, we are able to gain a better understanding of how the two domains interact to influence the membrane binding ability of SNX9.

Our analysis of the structure of SNX9PX-BAR shows a dimeric BAR domain that is moderately curved. The BAR domain forms stable dimers via mainly hydrophobic interactions on the membrane surface. Membrane binding is most likely driven by electrostatic interactions between the PX-BAR domain and the negatively-charged plasma membrane. In addition, the PX domain of SNX9 shows high and specific binding affinity to PI(3)P, which is in high concentrations in early endosomes. Therefore, we propose that SNX9 might be localized to both the plasma membrane and the early endosomes to participate in endocytosis and sorting of vesicles.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-06T16:26:17Z (GMT).

Almost all great civilizations have produced designs for gardens, pools and fountains that have gone beyond the practical needs and creation of aesthetically pleasing sights and sounds.

This thesis studies the symbolism used in most gardens of the 16th century, inspired by the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, written in 1499 by Francesco Colonna. The title of the Hypnerotomachya Poliphili is compounded of three Greek words, Hypnos (sleep), Eros (love), and Mache (strife). The sleep of Poliphilo, the narrator and protagonist, is the occasion for the erotic dream that comprises the entire novel. In the process of finding his lover, the protagonist explains how he adores architecture and gardens, wanders around old graveyards and delights in sculptures. This thesis narrates the novel, Hypnerotomachya Poliphili, through photographs of Italian gardens designed as stages on which the story of Poliphilo takes place. One walks around the gardens of the renaissance and sees the episodes of the story quietly performed through the fountains, sculptures and the design and the layout of the gardens.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-07-06T16:50:16Z (GMT).

This thesis investigates the announcement effects surrounding the passage of SOX to examine the differential impact of SOX on U.S. publicly traded companies.  As the Act requires greater transparency of financial reporting and imposes burden on managers through mandatory CEO/CFO certification of financial statements, the associated compliance costs create a significant loss in total market value that amounts to $1.4 trillion (Zhang 2005).  It is predicted that SOX has a disproportionate negative impact on small firms due to the fixed cost component of the compliance costs and the characteristics of small firms (i.e. they compete on flexibility but SOX limits it).  Previous studies show that the imposed compliance costs lead to a significant number of firms going dark or private in the post-SOX period, which suggests that the imposed compliance costs outweigh the induced benefits of SOX to shareholders (Engel 2004).  While past studies have been done to examine the effect of SOX on public firms in general, this thesis is specifically interested in how different firm sizes react differentially to the events leading the passage of SOX.  Through the event study methodology, the event day effect on stock returns and abnormal returns will be examined to see if the market also perceives the Act to have a negative impact on firms.","Made available in DSpace on 2007-08-08T17:21:16Z (GMT).

One hundred and two Cornell University undergraduates completed a decision making task involving hypothetical money and completed a survey that assessed their level of gist-based (intuitive) thinking about risk, verbatim (quantitative) risk perceptions, sexual history, and various personality traits. The decision making task used a within-subjects framing design; each participant chose between taking a sure option and gamble for problems varying in magnitude and risk level. Each problem in the gain frame was analogous to one in the loss frame. An overall standard framing pattern (risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for losses) was observed. Preference for the gamble also decreased with increasing levels of risk and magnitude of outcomes. Individual differences in task performance related to a number of survey measures. Most importantly, susceptibility to framing was linked to sexual activity, a measure of risky sexual behavior. Standard framers had the fewest number of sexual partners while reverse framers had the most. Furthermore, sexual activity negatively correlated with gist-based thinking about risk. Gambling in the gain frame correlated positively with sensation seeking scores, which correlated negatively with gist-based thinking. Overall gambling negatively correlated with intentions to use birth control. These results have implications for using framing tasks to study real world behavior and for the use of gist-based interventions to reduce young adult risk taking.",en_US,Gist,Framing Effects and Risky Decisions in Young Adults,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, I investigated the interactions between fuzzy-trace constructs of gist and verbatim thinking and parent values and friend norms. The results support the notion that family and peers both have salient influences on decision making in adolescents. Peers and parents also appear to influence the level of gist-based thinking that adolescents engage in, an indication that certain interactions with friends and parents can influence decision making maturity. Finally, the interaction between fuzzy-trace constructs and values reflects variance in several past behaviors and future intentions.

The interplay between poverty, allostatic load, and working memory has not been previously studied. The current investigation examines the influence of cumulative, physiological ""wear and tear"" (at ages 9 and 13) on working memory functioning (at age 17), in a low- and middle-income sample (N= 68 and 102 per group, respectively). As predicted, proportion of life spent in poverty was inversely related to working memory functioning, with decreased accuracy for individuals living in persistent poverty. This pathway was fully mediated by increased allostatic load in childhood and early adolescence.

To examine developmental differences in risky decision making within this theoretical framework, framing problems factorially crossing levels of risk (1/2, 1/3, 1/4) and outcome magnitude (low, medium, high) to create two blocks of nine framed problems were administered to 102 young adults and 51 adolescents.  In the gain-framed block, participants chose between a sure win and a possibility of either a larger win or nothing.  In the loss-framed block, participants were given an endowment and then chose between a sure loss and a possibility of either losing nothing or losing everything.  Consistent with fuzzy-trace theory?s predictions, collapsed across the medium and high levels of outcome magnitude adolescents focused more on the quantitative differences between outcomes and were more consistent in choice across frames, while adults relied more on qualitative distinctions between outcomes and displayed framing effects (risk aversion in the gain frame and risk-seeking in the loss frame).  At the highest level of outcome magnitude, adolescents displayed a reverse framing pattern (risk-seeking in the gain frame and risk aversion in the loss frame), suggesting a stronger focus on maximizing gains and minimizing losses when the stakes are high.  Participants also completed a survey assessing intuitive and quantitative risk perceptions, risky intentions and behaviors, sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation.  Intuitive thinking about risk was correlated with perceived global risks of sex and negatively correlated with perceived global benefits of having sex, intentions to have sex, total sexual partners, and sensation seeking, while quantitative risk assessment was correlated with total sexual partners.  This suggests that qualitative representations of risky situations are protective, while quantitative thinking supports risk-taking, findings which have potential policy implications for risk reduction in adolescents.",en_US,,Framing Effects and Risky Decision Making in Adolescents and Young Adults,Dissertation or Thesis,Senior Honors Thesis,College of Human Ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on previous research showing older adults? increased sensitivity for positive information, I hypothesized that older adults would exhibit greater memory, have greater preferences for, and be persuaded more by the positive ads versus the negative ads, while the younger adults would exhibit no differences between the positive and negative ads.  In the present study, older and younger participants viewed twelve valenced advertisements that covered six health care domains.  In response to these ads, both age groups rated them on likelihood to choose the item in the ad, likelihood to seek more information, and the persuasiveness of the ad.  Later their memory for the product name associated with each ad slogan was tested.  Lastly, the participants rated each ad on how positively and negatively the ad made them feel. Overall, the younger adults were more likely to choose the products and were more persuaded by the ads relative to the older adults.  The data also revealed that older and younger adults preferred, were more persuaded by, and better remembered the positive ads compared to the negative ads.

The effects of this food odorant/diet restriction response on the development of D. melanogaster larvae have never been tested, despite the possibility that nutrient availability, and, therefore, nutrient sensing, may be more important to this developmental stage than to an emerged adult fly. This study was performed to determine the effects of diet restriction and food odorants on the time and success of pupation and emergence in D. melanogaster. Equal numbers of eggs from two lines of flies, a mutant for the olfactory receptor gene Or83b and a control with the same genetic background, were exposed to four treatments of normal diet or restricted diet with or without yeast odorants.

As referenced through the theory of painting, pictorial form is created through the use of point and line to plane. An inherent parallelism is established between the act of creating form on a surface and man?s act of creating landscape. As humans we create the landscape through the body from eye to mind to hand. The idea of the point is expressed as the physical form of man in relation to the surface of the earth. Man interacts with his environment through the activation of that point into linear form. The intersections of linear form created makes visible the language of man?s relationship with his environment by creating, framing, and forming the horizontal plane of the landscape. The exploration into this process of making the landscape exposes man?s perception of his environment in a manner that begins a personal dialogue between the landscape and me.

Using information contained in the site frequency spectrum of purebred dogs and the Poisson Random Field framework, we infer the demography of the dog at domestication, in the formation of individual dog breeds, and of several wild canid populations. First, we find evidence for a slight contraction in population size approximately 15,000 years ago during the domestication of the dog. As these results may be an artifact of using breed dogs to infer a pre-breed dog population, it is likely that continued introgression between dogs and wolves or multiple domestication events have maintained high levels of dog diversity. Demography in the formation of several dog breeds is also examined, where the relatively rare breeds of the Bernese Mountain Dog and Pekingese appear to have gone through the most severe population contractions. In contrast, less severe contractions are found for the Golden and Labrador Retrievers, both popular breeds, and the Akita, which has likely introgressed with wolves. Finally, we examine data from several wild canid populations, finding evidence for population contractions in the gray wolf populations of Spain and Israel, but none in North American populations or coyote.

The purpose of this honors thesis is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of a key target audience for the HPV vaccine ? college undergraduates (particularly female) ? to determine what factors may be influencing its acceptance of the HPV vaccine. This study is based on the framework of Elaboration Parallel Processing Model and also looks into other risk perception issues such as optimistic bias.

Methods. 269 Cornell undergraduates returned a survey regarding sexual history, sexual health practices, understanding of the HPV vaccine, and attitudes toward the HPV vaccine. All participants were assured anonymity, and no identifying information was connected to their survey responses. The survey used a modified risk diagnostic scale in order to measure mindsets toward the HPV vaccine. The survey also used measures for optimistic bias and knowledge.

Results. Among key findings was a significant relationship between optimistic bias, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity. Specifically, as optimistic bias increases, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity decrease. On the other hand, discriminating value scores increase as optimistic bias increases. General knowledge of HPV showed significant positive correlations with perceived severity, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and perceived susceptibility. Exploratory analysis examined other factors for statistical significance.

Conclusions. The use of the risk diagnostic scale appears useful for understanding issues involved in acceptance and receiving of the HPV vaccine. Furthermore, by looking into key attributes such as knowledge, discriminating value, optimistic bias, and vaccine rates, the investigation was able to come up with concrete results that may be of use to health communicators and practitioners.",en_US,,Communication Issues Associated with the Likelihood of HPV Vaccine Acceptance among College Students,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the key causes of Fe deficiency is poor bioavailability of dietary Fe. Food fortification is a good strategy for combating Fe deficiency. This study compares the in vitro Fe bioavailability (bioaccessibility and cell uptake) from mung beans prepared by household cooking procedures, boiling and soak-boiling, and fortified with selected Fe fortificants. To estimate Fe bioavailability, an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model was used. Mung beans can constitute a good source of Fe since their concentrations were 60.1?1.5 ?g/g beans (dry basis). Although boiling did not affect Fe concentration in mung beans, the soak-boiling procedure decreased the Fe content by 16%. However, soak-boiling increased the Fe bioaccessibility up to 21% relative to boiled (9.1%) and raw beans (not detectable). Both cooking procedures decreased the content of phenolics; however, soak-boiling increased the soluble phytate in the digests. When comparing the effect of different fortificants, Fe bioavailability from beans fortified with SprinklesTM was higher than either FeSO4 or ferrous fumarate.

In conclusion, 1) cooking enhanced Fe bioavailability in non-fortified beans, and 2) fortification with SprinklesTM was the most effective strategy.",en_US,Caco-2 cell,Iron (Fe) Bioavailability from Mung Beans: Effects of Household Processing and Form of Fe Fortificants,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulated white sugar was fortified with NaFe-EDTA, iron bis-glycinate, elemental iron powder, or ferrous sulfate to yield an iron concentration of 0.12 mg/g sugar, with plain sugar as a control. Color change was monitored over three months by dissolving samples in water, and measuring the absorbance at 350 nm. A 12.5 g sugar sample was added to 250 mL of brewed green tea after each month and was monitored at 560 nm. Hard candy was made with each fortified sugar and the control (unfortified sugar), stored for three months, and monitored for color changes at 350 nm.

Color intensities of the fortified sugar relative to the unfortified control were as follows: iron bis-glycinate, NaFe-EDTA, ferrous sulfate, and elemental iron. These rankings changed little over time. Tea sweetened with fortified sugars ranked (most to least different from the control) as ferrous sulfate, iron bis-glycinate, NaFe-EDTA, and elemental iron. The candy didn?t visually change over time, although there were initial differences from the control candy. The color of the samples ranked (most to least different from the control candy) as iron bis-glycinate, ferrous sulfate, elemental iron, and NaFe-EDTA.

The best fortificant for sugar depended on the application.

Although they provide the benefit of large data sets from a wide area, the quality of the data is often questioned because they are collected by ?laypeople? with limited field experience. However, there are a number of side benefits of utilizing volunteers in research that may outweigh this concern: increased stewardship of the monitored habitat, educational benefits to participants, and community support for such research. The goal of many of these projects often is restoration or preservation of an area, and these side benefits may aid in meeting the end goal as much as the actual data collected. Many community based monitoring projects publish their results in scientific or technical literature with recommendations for similar future projects. This study determines if these recommendations match the best management practices actually used by programs. Also, this study compares recommendations and practices by habitat to see if more specificity is needed in thinking about improving the data coming from monitoring programs and allowing them to succeed at fulfilling their mission. A series of surveys of program coordinators and primary investigators were compared to recommendations in the literature to determine if published recommendations are a realistic representation of practices that occur in the field. Results showed that although the top recommendations of the literature and survey respondents were similar (championing collaboration with experts, consistent methodology, and presentation of data to policymakers), the means and implications of achieving these goals differs by habitat.

In this experiment, 48 multiparous Holstein cows were utilized to determine if trace mineral supplementation of inorganic or chelated organic sources at National Research Council or higher commercial levels would exhibit improved immune function after vaccination with a mastitis vaccine (J-5) and during a LPS challenge. Cows were fed a diet formulated to meet or exceed NRC (2001) requirements for all nutrients except the trace minerals of interest: Zn, Cu, and Mn. Cows were then assigned to four treatments containing organic or inorganic trace mineral sources at commercial or NRC levels. At the end of week two of treatment, cows were administered a J-5 vaccine and blood samples were collected to measure level of IgG production. At the end of week six of treatment cows were subjected to an intramammary LPS challenge. Heart rate and rectal temperature were measured and blood samples were drawn throughout the eight-hour challenge at thirty-minute intervals and again at 24 and 48 hours post challenge. Plasma IgG levels from samples collected on a weekly basis were highest for cows supplemented trace minerals in an organic form regardless of amount. Heart rate and rectal temperatures following LPS challenge did not vary between treatments.

Twenty-four cats one-year of age and older were observed in the Tompkins County SPCA for three consecutive days. All behavior was continuously recorded. Density of cats in the room and length of stay at the shelter were also recorded. To measure the effects of group housing on a cat?s behavior in relation to humans, a temperament test was performed each month for four months on a separate group of twenty-nine cats from the Tompkins County SPCA.

A reduction in stress was noted in cats staying in the shelter for over 8 months. These cats had a reduced ratio of negative (aggressive or defensive) interactions to total interactions, slept a more normal amount, and did not have inhibited grooming or movement. The number of cats in the room was correlated with an increased activity level and decreased sleep, because larger rooms had more human traffic. Negative interactions were positively correlated with time spent eating, indicating that cats had to stop avoidance behavior in order to reach the communal food bowl. The score the cat received on the temperament test did not vary significantly between test months.

Results indicate that the entry to the shelter environment is stressful, and the adjustment to group housing takes over 8 months. A four month stay in group housing did not seem to affect the temperament of a cat in relation to its behavior towards humans.",en_US,,The Effects of Group-Housing on the Behavior of Domestic Cats (Felis Sylvestris Catus) in an Animal Shelter,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All recordings and observations were conducted at the local fish farm located 200 meters from the shore in Golfo Aranci. Three hundred and eighty minutes of underwater sounds were recorded using a single hydrophone system during the months of June and July 2007. Whistles were separated both according to group size and group composition for statistical analysis. The acoustic characteristics of 176 whistles were classified based on eight parameters and compared with data of previous studies. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.457, p ? 0.001) was observed between whistle rates and group size observed at the time of measurement, supporting our hypothesis that whistle rates increase in groups of larger numbers as compared to groups of smaller numbers. Additionally, whistle production rates of adults in the presence of an immature calf showed a significant difference to those of any other group (p ? 0.05) having a higher whistle production rate (median = 0.5 whistles/minute/individual), while all other groups were not significantly different in the production of whistles (p values > 0.05, median = 0 whistles/minute/individual). Whistles recorded at Golfo Aranci were of longer duration and higher maximum and minimum frequencies than previous studies. The results suggest that bottlenose dolphin whistle rates are affected by both group size and composition, with higher whistle rates in larger groups and in the presence of immature dolphins.",en_US,,"Whistle Production Rates in a Group of Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops Truncatus) among Changes in Group Composition in Sardinia, Italy",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect of CLA has also been demonstrated in rodent models. The present study aimed to determine whether dietary fat level affects the response of the mammary gland to CLA in lactating mice. Wild type C57Bl/6J mice (n=31) nursing 6-8 pups were fed semi-purified diets containing either 4% fat (LF) or 24% fat (HF) starting 4-6 d after parturition. High oleic acid sunflower oil was substituted for corn starch to increase the fat content of the HF diet. After a 2 d pretreatment period, dams were orally dosed with water (control) or trans-10, cis-12 CLA (20 mg/d) for 5 d. CLA treatment decreased growth of the nursing litter similarly for both diets; no effect of dietary fat or interaction with CLA was observed. Milk fat percent was increased 16-17% by the HF diet and decreased 12-13% by CLA. Both CLA and the HF diet reduced the proportion of short and medium chain fatty acids in milk fat; these originate from de novo synthesis in the mammary gland. Conversely, the milk fat concentration of fatty acids >16 carbons in length was increased 62-63% by the HF diet, and substantial incorporation of dietary oleic acid into milk fat was observed. In conclusion, CLA caused a reduction in milk fat percent and litter growth that was not overcome by increased dietary fat.",en_US,,Effect of Dietary Fat Level on the Ability of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) to Inhibit Milk Fat Synthesis in Lactating Mice,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pregnant BALB/c dams received either plain tap water or water containing 10ppm HgCl2 ad libitum throughout gestation, and were switched to plain water after parturition. Adult offspring were immunized with 100?g DNP-KLH, and six weeks later, splenocytes were analyzed for immune phenotype and function. HgCl2 exposure resulted in alterations in splenocyte phenotype in response to DNP-KLH in male and female mice and increased proliferation of splenic lymphocytes to ConA or LPS; in female mice, there was a specific increase in the proliferative response to LPS. HgCl2 exposure did not affect IL-2 production by splenocytes in response to DNP-KLH. There was no effect of HgCl2 exposure on IFN-? or IL-4 production; however, the production of IFN-? or IL-4 in response to DNP-KLH was greater in mercury-exposed male versus female mice. IL-10 production by splenocytes in response to ConA was greater in mercury-exposed male versus female mice. After cells were cultured in media alone, cells from male mice produced greater levels of DNP-KLH-specific IgG as a result of HgCl2 exposure during gestation. HgCl2 exposure did not significantly affect the production of the DNP-KLH-specific immunoglobulins in response to DNP-KLH. Taken together, these data suggest that in utero exposure to HgCl2 may result in long-term gender-specific alterations of immune system responses.",en_US,immune phenotypes,Effects of Gestational Exposure to Mercury on Mitogen and Antigen-Specific Immune Responses,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SCF, initially created as reporting tool, was reintroduced into the school context to open the channels of communication between all parties involved in the reported concern. The forms are reviewed by the administrators of the school, and students are involved in resolution process. This paper analyzes the incidents reported and the actions taken by administrators and students to address the concerns. Specifically, this thesis examines the behaviors reported; what do the teachers and principal write about how the problem is resolved? How are students involved in the resolution process? What is the student?s sense of personal and interpersonal safety? Do these forms create a positive moral climate in the school?

However, most past research contains an important methodological flaw: the failure to break down deceptive and truthful topics into individual utterances. When assigning research participants to a deceptive role (say, asking them to lie to an unknowing receiver) previous studies have generally given the deceivers a topic to lie about and then asked them to go ahead and communicate with their partner. The deceivers were assumed to be lying whenever they were talking about the topic on which they were supposed to deceive their partners. However, in practice not all of the utterances within a deceptive conversation topic are lies. Some are truths used to support the overall lie. Past research has failed to make this distinction, drawing into question previous findings on linguistic cues. This study sought to validate four of the more well-known linguistic cues to deception by examining them at the utterance level. The results reveal that while there often is a distinction between the linguistic cues at the overall topical level (deceptive topics vs. truthful topics), those markers do not always hold true at the utterance level. Even more interestingly, there is often a large difference between truths told in support of an overall deceptive topic and truths told in support of an overall truthful topic.

After listening to the word lists, participants were then given an emotion induction task that induced moods by rating person descriptive words taken from the Dumas norms.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: positive, negative, or neutral.  Each participant was then given an immediate recognition memory test.  One week later, participants were given a delayed recognition memory test to measure the degree of false memory.  Results indicate that on the immediate memory participants in the positive mood condition were more susceptible to false memory.  On the immediate memory test it was also found that participants in the neutral condition had the highest acceptance rates for target words, suggesting they had the best true memory.  On the delayed memory test, it was found that participants in the negative condition were less likely to accept all types of words than participants in the negative and positive emotion conditions.  This finding is consistent with what was found on the immediate memory test.  Interestingly, on the delayed memory test participants in the positive emotional condition actually increased their acceptance rate for targets while participants in the neutral condition decreased their acceptance rates and participants in the negative condition kept their target rates consistent.","Made available in DSpace on 2008-09-30T19:25:04Z (GMT).

One area in which this influence can be observed is that of spatial relations. For example, in Dutch, the English category of support (""on"") is further subdivided into two categories, the distinction between which roughly corresponds to the difference between vertical (""aan"" in Dutch) and horizontal (""op"") (e.g., Bowerman, 1996). The linguistic relativity theory would predict that this dichotomy would be more easily perceivable to children who were being raised speaking Dutch than to children who were being raised speaking English. This experiment attempts to test the ability of English speaking two-year-olds to learn the spatial category. Twenty-two children between 25 and 30 months of age first underwent a short training session in which toy models demonstrating each of the spatial relations were presented along with a novel word. Children were then tested for comprehension in a preferential looking paradigm. Children provided no evidence that they learned  either of the two possible novel spatial categories (aan and op).

After viewing a video in which four speakers present various factual statements, participants were asked to recall the statements and indicate which speaker said the statement. Compared to older adults, younger adults recalled more details from the statements and had more correct source identifications.

Food sales data were analyzed before and after the nutrition labels went into effect. While a number of previous studies have shown that consumers use nutrition labels when purchasing foods, most of these studies have relied on self-reported data. Previous studies have also shown that consumers may not be able to apply the information on nutrition labels when trying to purchase healthier foods. Therefore, this study sought to determine whether the nutrition labels helped the Cornell community to purchase healthier foods. Foods sold in three dining locations throughout campus were categorized by their amount of calories, fat, sodium, percent calories from fat, and fiber. Food sales data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 16.0) to test for how sales data changed from spring 2007 to spring 2008. The results indicated that there were significant effects of the nutrition labels on which foods were purchased between the two years. Specifically, there was a decrease in the percentage of foods sold with high calories, fat, percent calories from fat, and sodium. However, there was also a decrease in the percentage of sales due to high fiber foods.

Towns and cities arise out of these necessities. Many people come together to build communities in order to form bonds. In the metropolitan setting where space is extremely limited, shared community gardens become the quintessential example of places that people use to reconnect with their physical surroundings and build social value. In more rural locations, people intentionally design shared spaces, yearning to rekindle communal living integral in urban environments. Cohousing developments are such places, which are founded upon the kinship ideal. Community gardens and cohousing developments are two disparate landscapes that exhibit the human need to connect. Physical layout comes secondary in these socially-constructed places; they are vehicles for cultivating strong relationships between people of shared values.

To better understand this phenomenon, this thesis will specifically explore three community gardens - the Liz Christy Bowery-Houston Garden, La Plaza Cultural, and 6BC Botanical Garden - in order to understand placemaking in action. Ongoing strategies that helped these communities develop ?place? will be outlined and critically evaluated. For consistent comparison, each garden will focus on the evolution of their governance. Cohousing developments will be as a way studied to first understand how socially-driven organizations assemble themselves. This thesis will conclude that such places, out of the desire to improve, create more organized, hierarchical governing systems over time.",,,Socially-Constructed Landscapes: Evolving Governing Structures to Sustain Community Gardens,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research into the early history and settlement patterns was undertaken as a tool for understanding the unique landscape identities of New England towns. An investigation of the historical background established the role of New England town greens as the religious, governmental, and social center of New England towns. The implications of this analysis justified the exploration of possible preservation methods.

Case studies of four New England towns in eastern Massachusetts - Holliston, Natick, Wellesley, and Wayland - concluded the research.

All species of teosinte can form hybrids with maize, of which crosses of maize with Z. mays ssp. mexicana and parviglumis are the most common and fertile. For this study, a set of near isogenic lines (NILs) derived from five teosinte accessions were used to examine resistance to the northern leaf blight (NLB), caused by Exserohilum turcicum.  The objective was to identify chromosomal segments introgressed from teosinte that affect the level of disease resistance when compared to the recurrent parent B73. Teosinte-maize introgression lines with enhanced resistance to NLB were identified, for both incubation period (IP) and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Some of the more resistant lines indentified contain teosinte introgressions in locations that correspond to previously identified NLB QTL. Several lines with lesion types distinct from B73 for overall lesion size, the extent of purple coloring around lesions and other characteristics were also noted. Further work is needed to determine whether introgressions at recognized QTL loci carry alleles that are not found in maize germplasm pool.

As a C4 plant, maize (Zea mays) utilizes two distinct cell types, known as bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M) cells to facilitate the photosynthetic activity. BS cells function to fix the carbon dioxide in the form of reduced carbohydrates and carry out mostly CEF for ATP production. In contrast M cells act as a carbon pump and provide carbon dioxide in the form of the C4 acid malate to BS cells and use LEF for ATP production. BS and M chloroplasts develop and differentiate from base to tip. In this honors thesis, I tested the hypothesis that with progressive leaf development, levels of Photosystem II proteins (OEC23, OEC33, D1, CP47) involved in LEF decrease in BS chloroplasts, while CEF proteins (NDH-L and PGR5) in the BS chloroplasts increase. This serves to switch from linear to cyclic electron flow in the BS chloroplasts along the leaf developmental gradient. Additionally, I investigated relationships between mRNA and protein levels of the selected CEF and LEF components to understand transcriptional and translational controls. Proteins and RNA were extracted from BS strands isolated from four different leaf sections of 9 day old plants and analyzed by western blot and reverse transcript - polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). My analysis showed increased levels of mRNA and proteins of all measured components from base to the middle of the leaf, followed by additional increase or decrease towards the leaf tip. These results suggest both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms in maize leaf development. My data also suggest that BS cells isolated near the tip were not fully differentiated at the sampling stage.",en_US,maize,Expression of Linear and Cyclic Electron Flow Components in the Bundle Sheath Chloroplasts Along the Developmental Leaf Gradient of Maize (Zea mays),Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, rising malpractice insurance costs and Caesarean sections in obstetrical practices are indicators that American approaches to childbirth need to be reevaluated (MacDonald, 2007; DeVries, 2001).  Midwifery, which focuses on health care in pregnancy and birth, has been shown to be a successful healthcare approach for non-high-risk pregnancies (Rooks, 1997; Mander, 2001).  Midwives are trained in a variety of childbirth-related practices and emphasize pregnancy and birth as normal.  Although many midwives share views on how birth should be handled, midwifery has been divided into various schools of thought that range in their willingness to include medical interventions, affiliate with mainstream health care systems and incorporate alternative, homeopathic remedies into the practice.  
	This study was designed to acquire in-depth knowledge about how midwives choose to develop their practices.  Four midwives with different training backgrounds who work in Ithaca, New York, were selected to participate in the study.  Interviews were conducted in the workplaces and/or homes of the midwives and further information was acquired through follow-up questioning.  The information from the interviews was analyzed within the context of the history and politics of midwifery in the US.  In addition, special consideration was taken for the midwives? international training and work experience.  Comparisons were drawn between midwifery models in the US and other countries such as Canada, Cambodia and England.   
	Analysis of the interviews revealed a complex relationship between the midwives? personal philosophies, training, workplace and practice.  Each of the factors is inextricably tied to the other and influences how the midwives incorporate medical technology, female empowerment and spirituality into their care.  
	Because philosophy, training, workplace and practice are all crucial in developing a midwifery practice, limitations on any of these elements could be detrimental to the field.  For example, the US sets strict limits on where certain midwives can work and how they obtain insurance.  As a result, many midwives are forced to make sacrifices in their practice to compromise for the legal and political restrictions imposed on them.  Other regions, such as Ontario, Canada, have designed models for midwifery that promote quality health care without relegating midwives to one specific workplace, training style, philosophy or practice.  There is reason to conduct further research to compare US and Canadian models so that evidence-based changes to maternity care in the US can be made.",en_US,midwifery,"The Confluence of Practice, Philosophy, Work Space and Education: A Case Study of Four Contemporary Midwives in Central New York",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is due to the high fraction of fermentable neutral detergent fiber (FNDF) found in soy hulls, which is highly digestible by rumen microbes and may optimize VFA production for rumen health. However, high levels of intake of a soy hull diet can decrease digestibility due to an increased rate of passage. In this project, the effect of feeding soy hull-based diets at intake levels of 2, 3, or 4% of body weight was quantified in weanling ram lambs and mature, non-lactating ewes. The apparent dry matter digestibility (DMD) and digestibility of NDF were quantified using a chromium marker which was measured in the feed and feces. In ram lambs, apparent DMD decreased by 8.3 percentage units and digestibility of NDF decreased by 12.1 percentage units for each 1 percentage unit increase in DMI as a percentage of BW (P<0.001). In mature ewes, the depression in digestibility was less pronounced, with DMD decreasing by 2.9 percentage units and digestibility of NDF decreasing by 4.5 percentage units for each 1 percentage unit increase in DMI as a percentage of BW (P = 0.034). These experiments demonstrated a linear decrease in digestibility with increased intake, and the decrease was less severe in sheep being fed at or near their maintenance requirement.",en,digestibility,The Effect of Intake Level of a Soy Hull Diet on Digestibility in Ram Lambs and Mature Non-Lactating Ewes,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter is characterized by a change in sperm motility from symmetrical flagellar bends to vigorous, asymmetrical, high-amplitude flagellar bends, with the pattern of motility being species-specific.  The main trigger responsible for the initiation of hyperactivated motility is an increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+ arising potentially from both intracellular and/or extracellular sources. Therefore, pharmacological reagents that increase intracytoplasmic Ca2+ have been used to induce hyperactivation in sperm from a variety of species.  Recently, hyperactivation has been characterized for stallion sperm using procaine treatment, a reagent hypothesized to increase membrane permeability to extracellular Ca2+.  Since hyperactivation of stallion sperm is crucial for supporting in vitro fertilization (IVF), this study examined the effect of exposing equine sperm to different concentrations of caffeine, thimerosal and thapsigargin, three reagents demonstrated to induce hyperactivation in other species.  Sperm from three ejaculates from each of three stallions were exposed to concentrations gradients of each of these reagents to examine their effect of sperm hyperactivation using a computerized sperm motility analyzer (CASA) to measure motion parameters associated with this pattern of motility. In all experiments, positive controls included treatment with procaine. All three reagents tested failed to induce hyperactivation in the stallion, suggesting physiological differences in the response of stallion sperm to these reagents as compared to other species.",en_US,stallion,"The Effect of Caffeine, Thimerosal and Thapsigargin on Stallion Sperm Hyperactivation",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daily feed intake and weekly body weight change of individual pigs were recorded, and blood samples of individual pigs were taken weekly to measure plasma inorganic phosphorus concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity.  Pigs fed the wild-type and the AppA2 mutant phytases had higher (P < 0.01) plasma inorganic phosphorus concentrations from week 2 through week 4 and lower (P < 0.05) plasma alkaline phosphatase activity in week 4 than did pigs fed the BD or the PhyA mutant. The latter two groups showed similar values in these measures. The overall growth performance of pigs was not affected by the dietary treatments. In conclusion, the AppA2 mutant phytase engineered for improved thermostability was as effective as the wild-type in releasing phytate-phosphorus from the diet for weanling pigs.

In a replicated four-by-four Latin square trial, eight ewes and their twin lambs were fed four different diets.  The four diets were: Diet A, a wheat middling and corn concentrate fed with a mixed grass hay; Diet B, an okara and corn concentrate fed with mixed grass hay; Diet C, a soybean meal and wheat middling concentrate fed with haylage; and Diet D an okara and corn concentrate fed with haylage.  Ewe weights, lamb weights and daily feed intakes were recorded and milk samples were taken to determine the effect of the diets on the growth and feed intake of the animals and milk composition.  The diets had no statistically significant impact on ewe or lamb growth, overall dry matter intake or growth efficiency, but there was significant difference in the amount of different diet forage and concentrate consumed.  There was also no effect on milk composition, though there were some trends observed.

The majority of pawing observations were recorded in the afternoon with an average number of 79.8 percent occurring in the afternoon, while an average of 20.2 percent of pawing observations occurred in the morning. These findings indicate that greater than half of the observed population of Standardbreds exhibited pawing behavior, and within the pawing group the majority showed significantly more pawing behavior during the afternoon observation (P<0.05).

Trans-10, cis-12 CLA inhibits de novo milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland through a coordinated downregulation of key lipogenic enzymes and the nuclear protein thyroid hormone responsive spot 14 (S14). A previous study using a mouse model showed that the S14 knockout (KO) mouse was hyperresponsive to CLA. In KO mice, mammary lipogenesis decreased by 82% in response to a 5-day treatment of 20 mg/d trans-10, cis-12 CLA, whereas in wildtype (WT) controls, rates of lipogenesis decreased by 23%. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the KO mouse was also hypersensitive to CLA. This was done by testing the lactogenic response of the KO mice to a low dose of CLA. WT and KO C57BL/6J mice were orally administered with either water (control) or 3.5 mg/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA for 5 days. In response to CLA treatment, KO dams had a 28.7% reduction in the percentage of de novo synthesized fatty acids in milk, whereas in WT dams this reduction (8.9%) was not significant, and there was an interaction of genotype and CLA treatment. Investigations with mammary explants demonstrated that lipogenic capacity decreased in both KO and WT dams, but there was no interaction of genotype and CLA treatment. A compilation of results from the present study and from previous studies suggests that the ED50 of CLA of the WT and KO mice are similar, thus indicating that the sensitivity of the two genotypes are similar.  Therefore, the S14 KO mouse is hyperresponsive to CLA-induced inhibition of mammary lipogenesis but sensitivity is unaltered.",en_US,S14,"Sensitivity of the S14 Null Mouse to trans-10, cis-12 Conjugated Linoleic Acid in the Regulation of Milk Fat Depression",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, pigs were either fed an iron deficient basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2,000 phytase U/kg of feed. In this experiment, weanling pigs had access to a commercial creep feed prior to being fed the experimental diets, and the pigs were initially less anemic than pigs in Experiment 2. Supplemental phytase had no apparent effect on intrinsic iron bioavailability in Experiment 1.  In Experiment 2 pigs were fed an iron deficient creep feed and weaning diet prior to being fed one of three experimental diets. In Experiment 2, pigs fed the iron deficient basal diet had lower growth performance, packed cell volume, and blood hemoglobin concentrations than pigs fed the basal diet supplemented with 2,500 phytase U/kg of feed, or the basal diet supplemented with inorganic iron at 40 mg/kg of feed. Phytase supplementation in a wheat-based diet appears to improve intrinsic iron bioavailability, and appears to correct iron deficiency as effectively as supplementing a source of inorganic iron in swine diets. These results highlight the necessity for using sensitive models when investigating nutrient bioavailability.

Consequently, some animals develop stereotypic behaviors such as cribbing, an oral stereotypy linked to bowel obstruction, lower learning ability, dental wear, weight loss and general loss in value. The present study tested surgically-placed ""crib rings"" for their efficacy in cribbing control and effects on welfare. Six adult horses with a long-term history of cribbing were used. Small hog rings (copper covered steel, 1-5/32"" or 1-1/2"") were placed into each horse's gums, between the upper incisors, under sedation with 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg Detomidine. They were recorded 24 hours per day in the stall with a mounted camera and a time-lapse recorder and recorded grazing with a handheld video camera in five-minute intervals several times per week. Blood was drawn daily to test for plasma cortisol concentration. Horses were observed for several weeks before and after surgery. Average time spent cribbing and eating, average bites per minute grazing and average cortisol levels were calculated and compared using the student?s paired t-test with alpha-level 0.05. Horses spent significantly less time cribbing (P=0.002) and more time eating (P=0.002) post-operation. They also took significantly fewer bites per minute grazing with the rings placed (P=0.004). Cortisol levels were significantly higher (p=0.001) on surgery day but dropped by day one; there was no significant increase post-surgically. Thus, overall crib rings appeared effective in decreasing cribbing behavior. Four of the six horses, however, returned to cribbing due to loss or bending of the rings, thus long term efficacy is questionable. Increased post-surgical eating may have been a replacement for cribbing. Longer eating time and less grazing may also indicate discomfort; however, cortisol results did not indicate chronic stress.",en_US,stereotypies,The Efficacy and Welfare Implications of Surgically-placed Crib Rings in Horses (Equus caballus),Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While much is known regarding HH actions in the Drosophila ovary, its role in the developing mammalian ovary remains a mystery. In the days following birth, the mouse ovary transitions from an organ filled with ovigerous cords to one filled with primordial follicles, which are oocytes surrounded by a layer of flattened pre-granulosa epithelial cells, enclosed by a basement membrane, and associated with mesenchymal cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the role HH plays in primordial follicle formation in the mouse ovary. HH signaling was blocked by injecting cyclopamine, a plant alkaloid known to inhibit HH signaling, on days 0, 1, 2 and 3 after birth. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody for laminin, a common basement membrane protein, revealed a significantly higher number of discontinuous basement membranes around primordial follicles in ovaries extracted from cyclopamine-treated mice. H&E staining revealed a significantly lower ratio of mesenchymal cells to oocytes in ovaries from cyclopamine-treated mice, as compared to controls. The reduced HH signaling in this study is thought to have disrupted proper ovigerous cord breakdown and interfered with normal cell communication among oocytes, epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells, suggesting that the HH signaling pathway does play a critical role in directing correct primordial follicle development. This study provides valuable insight into the role HH plays in the developing mouse ovary.",en_US,follicle development,Hedgehog Signaling Plays a Critical Role in Directing Correct Primordial Follicle Formation in the Mouse Ovary,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A web based survey was used to ascertain a wider scope of public views on airports as well as gathering opinions on some of the critical questions surrounding their future. Namely should the airport be connected to its local region, then should the airport be opened up as a citywide destination to the public [or non-passengers], and finally should the airport become a forum of social networking? Synthesizing these responses with different readings on airports as well as a variety of observations a framework for analyzing and designing these environments emerged. By considering earlier models in an attempt to understand the evolution of airport typologies and their connection to the urban landscape the concept anthroportscape was developed. The anthroportscape is the democratic, resilient, organic, and sustainable progressive evolutionary pathway of the airport. As the focus of this honors thesis investigation applying this urban design framework to the southern Indian city of Hyderabad yielded many fruitful speculations for sustainable development of the city and region. This further reinforced the conclusion that airports can drive sustainable urban development. Landscape architects mediating between multiple scales of development will play a critical role in airport design. This new paradigm of design will involve a broader spectrum of designers, planners, and thinkers.",en_US,,Anthroportscapes,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the shortcomings of many of these indices is that they are mainly based on observations from the southern Plains.  Severe thunderstorms can occur in the northeastern United States in conditions which significantly differ from those expected in the Plains.  Few attempts have been made to modify these indices for thunderstorms in the Northeast.  A new set of values specifically for use in the Northeast are computed.  The stability indices examined are the Showalter index, lifted index, SWEAT, K index, total totals, CAPE, CIN, and equilibrium level pressure.  Thunderstorms which occurred between the months of June through August during 1998-2007 are used in this analysis.  Upper air data from radiosondes at eight sites in the Northeast are used to calculate the new index values.  These data are analyzed with respect to the presence or absence of severe thunderstorms within 150 km and plus/minus 3 hours of a sounding.  Using these criteria, there are 423 soundings which contained severe thunderstorms and 13,012 soundings which do not.  Forecast skill is calculated for each index.  The best predictor in most cases is the LI, with CAPE a close second.  For most indices, the threshold which result in the best forecast indicate less instability than what is typically required in the Plains.   Probability density functions and scatter plots are created to visualize the data for all soundings.",en_US,,Analysis of Stability Indices for Severe Thunderstorms in the Northeastern United States,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in this study of New York State's rainfall climatology, watersheds were limited to those with less than 150 square miles.  In order to identify a trend in the data, stream gauges with a record of at least 40 years of continuous data were considered.  Finally, gauges were used if they had location coordinates which allowed them to be mapped on Google Earth.  Streams were then classified into urban, urbanizing, or rural urbanized categories.

To identify the most intense events for each stream, an equation that would compute a flow index was derived and used to rank the events within a stream.  Criteria for consideration included 24-hour events with at least twice the flow on the event day as compared to the previous and following days.  This isolates the high-rate events that we are most interested in.  Snow pack created an issue by contaminating the flood data. Therefore, only storms from April through November were considered, and the end months were checked for lingering snow pack effects.
  
The top forty events for each site were ranked.  There were no observable patterns between wet and dry years.  This fact remained the same when the results were reproduced for the sets based on urbanization.  When two sample sites were paired with rain gauges, a weak relationship between the heaviest rainfall events and the heaviest stream flow events was observed.",en_US,,A Study of 24-hour High Flow Events in Small Scale New York State Watersheds,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary focus is on the transition from socialist policies characterized by the creation of cooperatives, state farms, and communal villages; to market-led transformations characterized by a system of private property in land and a system of production and exchange for the market.  In the process, I look at the IMF-imposed Structural Adjustment Program and the civil war with the Renamo (The Mozambican National Resistance) movement that was armed and backed by apartheid South Africa, in shaping the nature of this transition. 
	I find that the creation of cooperatives, state farms, and communal villages was not successful at integrating peasants and bringing together communities to increase production largely because the policies implemented did not reflect the needs and desires of the peasantry. They often were inimical to the situation many peasants found themselves in. I also find that the liberalization of the economy was laden with policies that were unfavorable to the peasantry. The privatization of the cooperatives and state farms was accompanied by the reduction of state funded projects such as the development of rural infrastructures and road networks that are crucial in linking peasants to marketplaces. 
	In the future, Mozambique will need to empower local communities and develop rural markets and infrastructure if it is to increase production and generate a positive dynamic of development that can improve rural peoples livelihood and decrease levels of poverty.",en_US,,Agrarian Change and Social Transformation in Mozambique: 1928-2006,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), a new member of the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase family of enzymes, is primarily responsible for the production of thyroid hormone through its generation of hydrogen peroxide. In addition to hypothyroidism, here we report that global knockout of the DUOX2 gene in mice causes both hypotension and bradycardia basally, which are independent of locomotor activity and that which cannot be rescued by thyroid hormone supplementation. Furthermore, DUOX2 knockout mice exhibit a classical 'dipper' profile, which is, at least in part, the result of increased sympathetic control of basal heart rate. Moreover, we report that DUOX2 null mice exhibit an increased baroreflex sensitivity, which was tested by both spontaneous baroreflex analysis and classical vasoactive drug administration. Supplemental real-time PCR and in situ hybridization studies confirm the genotype of DUOX2 null mice and demonstrate that DUOX2 is not expressed in the thyroid of null mice, providing rationale for the low plasma T4 levels observed in DUOX2-/- mice at baseline. In conclusion, we have determined that DUOX2-mediated pathways participate in the regulation of both blood pressure and heart rate and that this occurs via mechanisms independent of thyroid hormone synthesis.",en_US,,"Dual Oxidase 2 Mediates Cardiovascular, Autonomic, and Baroreflex Function: An in vivo Study in Conscious Mice",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Escape from vacuoles is in part mediated by a broad-range phospholipase C (PC-PLC) whose activity is regulated by pH. Deletion of the sequence coding for the PC-PLC propeptide (plcB?pro) generates an enzyme that is constitutively active. Results from oral mouse infections indicated that L. monocytogenes plcB?pro is cleared more rapidly from the intestinal tissues than wild-type bacteria. We hypothesized that the loss of regulation of PC-PLC leads to an enhanced immune response to infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected mice by gavage with either wild-type or mutant bacteria, and we used uninfected mice as controls. The mice were sacrificed between 4 and 40 hours post-infection, and the intestines were collected and processed for evaluation of neutrophil infiltration by immunohistochemistry or for identification of immune cells populating the intestinal tissues by flow cytometry. We observed that the loss of regulation of PC-PLC activity does not change the kinetics, but slightly reduces the overall extent of neutrophil recruitment. However, by 40 hours post-infection there was an increase in the proportion of CD4+ CD8+ T cells in the epithelium; increases in the proportions of macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B lymphocytes in the lamina propria; and increases in macrophages, natural killer cells and natural killer T cells in the lymph follicles.

The activity of large conductance Ca2+-and-voltage-gated potassium channels (BK channels) is an important regulator of chromaffm cell excitability. The subunits, ?2, ?4, and the stress-regulated Slo-? splice variant, STREX, modulate the kinetic properties of BK channels and their sensitivity to chemicals. Previous research has found gender dimorphisms in the expression of Slo-?, ?2, and STREX mRNA in adrenal medullae from adult SJL mice, with males showing significantly higher expression than females. Recent literature has also identified chronic-stress-dependent increases in the expression of Slo and STREX mRNA in the adult male SJL adrenal medulla. The SJL mouse strain is of interest, as adult SJL males differ from females in size, behavior, and adrenal morphology. This investigation used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to examine changes in the expression of Slo, STREX, ?2, ?3, and ?4 mRNA in the SJL mouse adrenal medulla with respect to gender, stress, and age. Among adult mice tested for Slo, STREX, and ?2, males showed significantly higher mRNA expression in all subunits compared to females. Male adolescent mice showed higher mRNA expression of Slo, STREX, ?2, ?3, and ?4 compared to females, significantly for ?2. Stress increased the expression of all BK subunits in adolescent mice, significantly for ?2, ?3 and STREX. In age comparisons, adolescent mice showed significantly higher expression of ?2 mRNA and significantly lower expression of Slo and STREX mRNA compared to adults. These results suggest male mice have more excitable chromaffin cells than do females and provide evidence for a role of chronic stress in shaping excitability and, in turn, levels of catecholamines in the blood.",en_US,,"Gender, Age, and Stress Plasticity in BK Channel Expression in the Mouse Adrenal Medulla",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parenting, performed solely by the mother in elephants, is a long-term and psychologically important behavior which may vary between forest elephants, L. africana cyclotis, and savanna elephants, L. africana africana. Three ecological factors are of particular interest in the rarer and lesser-known forest subspecies: smaller family group size than in savanna elephants; the dispersal of adult females along with adolescent males; and the presence of highly contested mineral pits in forest clearings (bais). Despite the fact that forest elephant calves have few family members present, they do not engage in friendly mother-calf interactions at higher rates than do their savanna counterparts. The fact that both male and female forest elephants disperse may account for a decrease in friendly mother-calf interactions with age, consistent with explanations for an analogous decrease among savanna elephant males (Lee 1986). The rate of maternal aggression increased as forest elephant females aged, likely due to increased competitiveness with the mother for mineral pits, while the rate decreased for more independent males. In examining the dispersal syndrome, it appears that longer separations from the mother do not represent a preparatory behavior, since age of the calf did not significantly affect the duration for either male or female calves. The presence of an older sibling, who may act as an allomother, did, however. This research underscores the importance of mineral pits as an influence on the family dynamics in bais, given that aggression revolved around pits, calves often wandered in order to access pits, and mothers did not frequently initiate reunion with separated calves due to occupation of a pit.",en_US,,"Ontogeny of the Mother-calf Relationship in African Forest Elephants, Loxodonta africana cyclotis",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After examining a large-scale microarray study, two of the most dysregulated genes were Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein encoded by the GJAP1 gene, which provides routes for the movement of low-molecular weight materials, and Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a surface lubricating protein.

Using more advanced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, Cx43 was found to be expressed 7-fold higher in OCD cartilage than normal cartilage, and PRG4 was found to be expressed 3-times lower in OCD cartilage than normal cartilage. Through histological methods of immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization, Cx43?s expression and translation were found to be around the area of osteoclasts/ chondroclasts as well as the subchondral bone separation as a result of the OCD lesion with clefting.

A second experiment was performed with the same playback apparatus to quantify the temporal characteristics of electrical responses to agonistic signals called 'rasps'. Rasps consist of two bursting patterns: a fast burst (FBr) with inter-spike intervals (ISIs) of 8-20ms, followed by a medium burst (MBr) with ISIs of 30-70ms and are performed when males fight for dominance status, as well as during courtship. Experimental stimulus rasp patterns were gathered from dominant and subordinate males in 3 different contexts, and a looped pattern of natural nocturnal swimming discharges was used as a control.

Testing 14 fish, it was found that rasps quickened in response to the experimental stimuli along three different temporal parameters: rasps/second, rasp duration (seconds) and the shortest ISI achieved (ms). Many dominant individuals were observed 'rasp matching' the experimental stimuli, while several subordinates went silent during playback.  The dominance status of experimental fish was also measured and revealed that dominant males performed rasps at a higher rate and with shorter ISIs than subordinate males.

Key enzymes in the protozoan pathway, one of which is purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), exhibit important differences from the human homologs, indicating that inhibitors could be identified that affect TvPNP but not the human pathway, as a new class of chemotherapeutic agents against the T. vaginalis parasite. The native structure of TvPNP was determined in previous research in order to determine the basis for substrate binding and selectivity. However, the hypothesized interaction between the ligands and the key residue, Asp-204, at the active site of TvPNP was not observed. Thus, our goal is to further understand the active site of TvPNP, particularly with respect to Asp-204 in terms of substrate specificity. To do this, the crystallization of the D204N TvPNP mutants with adenosine and inosine were undertaken, and the interactions between the ligands and the enzyme were analyzed in light of kinetic data.",en_US,,Crystallographic Studies on Mutants of Trichomonas vaginalis Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

research examines how architecture, engineering, landscaping, and educational systems
are combined to make school buildings the instruments through which students learn how
to lessen human impact on the environment. Through tours, interviews, archival data,
and surveys with data from England, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Japan,
this thesis investigates factors involved in eco-school development, and documents four
eco-schools' design, activities, and students'  environmental attitudes. The specific aims
are:
Aim 1. (a) What factors aid eco-school development, and (b) in what kind of social
contexts does this occur? Interviews with principals, architects, and government
officials revealed that eco-schools develop quickly with enthusiastic principals who
excite their students, faculty, and school board members with occasions to think and act
in ecologically responsible ways.
Aim 2. What are contemporary exemplars of eco-schools, in architecture and
activities? Four contemporary eco-school exemplars were studied in England, the
Netherlands, and Japan. These schools had an average of 14 environmental features, with
the most common being utilizing daylight. Average number of environmental activities
was 5.5, with gardening and field trips as the most common. Eco-school activities varied
considerably with curriculum integration, alternative transportation, and demandreducing
policies.
Aim 3. Can eco-schools influence a child's way of thinking in different ways than
traditional schools, in terms of environmental attitudes? Across four schools studied,
the average environmental attitudes score was 84.43, using a 28 item adapted scale from
Musser and Malkus (1994). Although findings indicated that the number of
environmental features in a school was not a significant predictor of environmental
attitudes, this may be due in part to the fact that all schools studied were eco-schools.
Future research might include schools varying more in both design and curriculum.",en_US,children?s environmental attitudes,Fostering Whole-Systems Thinking Through Architecture: Eco- School Case Studies in Europe and Japan,Dissertation or Thesis,"Undergraduate Honors Thesis, Spring 2009","Acknowledgements

However, determining appropriate target strength (TS) thresholds for SL is more difficult due to the greater variability of orientation of fish and thus greater variability in the TS compared to DL. In this paper, I derive appropriate TS thresholds for SL acoustics in two alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) dominated lakes, one in New York and the other in Pennsylvania. I use ex situ TS distribution of alewife from a net cage experiment as well as in situ TS distribution of alewife from the lakes to determine the appropriate TS thresholds. With the thresholds applied, I explore the feasibility of using SL deployment as a fisheries assessment technique by comparing fish density estimates of SL with DL and multimesh vertical gill nets. DL and SL acoustic surveys were conducted at Cayuta Lake in October 13, 2008 and October 29, 2007, and at Silver Lake in October 14, 2008. In addition, vertical gill nets were set in the lakes for length (mm), weight (g), and distribution in the top 6 m. Ex situ net cage experiments were conducted in 2006 at Oneida Lake using 5 alewives. Results from the net cage experiment shows a TS distribution that is both wide and skewed to the right with more targets observed that are greater than -55 dB compared to in situ TS distribution at Cayuta Lake and Silver Lake. SL deployment at Cayuta Lake and Silver Lake observed more targets per km than DL deployment. The catches of alewife in the gill nets at Cayuta Lake in 2008 and 2007 were unevenly distributed with a greater proportion of alewife, both young-of-the-year (YOY) and adults, caught in the top 2 m. Catches of alewife in Silver Lake were more evenly distributed with an equal proportion of YOY alewife caught between 0-6 m, whereas the adults were only caught between 0-4 m. Hydroacoustic and vertical gill net abundance comparisons shows a positive correlation between gill net catch/hr with SL acoustics. However, the correlation between gill net and DL acoustics is negative. I conclude that this study demonstrates the importance of using SL and DL deployment of transducers in abundance estimation. Traditional gear like vertical gill nets should also be used in order to obtain accurate assessment of species and size structure. Further study of the TS distribution of alewife in net cages using SL deployment is needed to improve the determination of the appropriate TS thresholds for data analysis.",en_US,,Analysis of Side-Looking Deployment of Hydroacoustic Transducers in Fisheries Science,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPI, starch and paper are all sustainable, plant-based and yearly renewable materials.  In addition, these composites offer the use of recycled paper to produce high value-added products.  These composites can be engineered with desired properties to replace currently available petroleum-based composites for a variety of applications, including packaging, furniture, car parts, etc.  The benefits of using these ""green"" composites, as opposed to petroleum-based composites, include a) elimination of pollution during production of composites, b) capability of composting without harming the environment at the end of their life, c) the elimination of harsh chemicals that can be dangerous for workers as well as the users of the product and d) the sequestration of carbon dioxide.
In this thesis, fully biodegradable composites based on a variety of papers and biodegradable resins were prepared and characterized. The resin also contained plasticizers to control their mechanical properties. First, fully biodegradable SPI-based resin was prepared using glycerol as a plasticizer as well as Phytagel to enhance the mechanical properties. Additionally, fully biodegradable starch-based resins were prepared using modified starch with sorbitol as a plasticizer additive in various forms to enhance the mechanical properties. A total of six different starch-based resins were prepared, along with a total of three additives. These resins showed excellent mechanical properties, with the greatest strength being provided by the pre-gelatinized maize starch with glycol stearate (MGS) with the addition of 30% by weight Carboxyl Methyl Gum (CMG) additive and 5% by weight sorbitol plasticizer. These resins were then impregnated into recycled paper products and hot pressed into composite sheets. The recycled paper composites with the best mechanical properties were various paper towels (Georgia-Pacific Acclaim and en-Motion paper towels) and Cornell Daily Sun newspaper. This thesis discusses the mechanical properties of the resins and the composites.",en_US,Green composites,"""Green"" Composites Based on Recycled Paper Products and Biodegradable Resins",Dissertation or Thesis,,"Human Ecology Alumni Association

One such restriction was the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). The MSA had three main components: (1) a tax-like increase in cigarette prices, (2) the publication of tobacco industry documents and (3) advertising restrictions. The advertising restrictions are the main focus of this study and include, among other restrictions,  the elimination of “youth targeted” advertisements, cartoon advertisements (such as Joe Camel), and outdoor advertisements.. These rulings had large ramifications on the tobacco industry but not all companies reacted in the same manner. This study sought to determine how the MSA affected the number of tobacco advertisements in all magazines as well as only in magazines with high youth-exposure. Additionally, it compared the reactions of Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to the MSA in relation to each of the aforementioned subsets of advertisements. As predicted, after the MSA the number of advertisements increased in the short term but, concurrently, in the long run the rate at which advertisements were placed decreased. Additionally, Philip Morris followed the above trend but RJ Reynolds reacted in a radically differently manner; in such that they decreased their advertisements in the short run but decreased the rate at which their number of advertisements fell in the long term. Overall, this study confirms previous findings that the MSA led to major changes in the manner in which s the cigarette industry advertised, and that the two largest cigarette manufacturers reacted differently to the new regulations.",,Smoking,No More Youth Advertising?

To verify mood induction, the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) was administered shortly before an immediate memory recognition task was given. One week later, subjects completed the PANAS again, and were thereafter given a delayed recognition test to measure the level of performance and degree of forgetting between session one and session two, as well as overall memory performance and types of changes.  Results indicate that on the immediate test, there was a significant type of test item effect since no participants incorrectly identified semantically related or unrelated distractors.  While there was no main effect of condition (emotion) on the immediate test, there was both a type of test item effect as well as a strong condition effect on the delayed recognition task.

Because emotions must be recognized and decoded before this behavior occurs, it seems logical to assume emotional understanding must develop before empathy. Although all major empathy theories state this, there have been few studies actually researching this link. The present study seeks to find a relationship and developmental pathways between these two constructs. Twelve and 24-month old children (N=14) were studied on two main tasks; emotional development, which involved both a recognition and understanding component, and an empathy task where an experimenter feigned being hurt and tried to illicit a response from the infant. Preliminary results showed that infants categorized as high empathy made a greater distinction among emotions, suggesting they may have had greater emotional recognition and understanding. Future research should continue to examine this link and the implications of the relationship between emotional understanding and empathy.",en_US,empathy,Emotion Recognition and Understanding as it Relates to Empathetic Displays of Behavior in 12 and 24-Month Olds,Dissertation or Thesis,,Dr. Marianella Casasola,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-report questionnaires were administered to 101 young and 95 older adults. Young adults reported slightly higher loneliness than older adults. Overall, young and older participants who reported the greatest amount of loneliness experienced significantly less positive affect than those reporting the least amount of loneliness. However, higher levels of loneliness were related to increased negative affect only within the older adult group. Increased loneliness was also correlated with poorer reports of physical health exclusively in older adults. No relationships were found between loneliness and fluid cognitive ability or loneliness and information processing style. The exacerbated negative impact of loneliness in older adults is interpreted as an effect of age-related changes in motivation toward socioemotional goals related to the limited future time perspective of older individuals.",en_US,wellbeing,Loneliness and Wellbeing in Young and Older Adulthood,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very little research has been done on the context of magical thinking, specifically how children use magic to reason causally.  The present study explored magical causal explanations in 32 preschoolers, broken into 16 3 year-olds and 16 4 year-olds. Children saw blocks activate a special toy either working by contact or at a distance and were then asked to categorize whether the event was magic or electric. They were then asked to activate the toy themselves and then to correct the experimenter’s failed action. Children fell into one of three categories. They were either Inconsistent in their categorizations, Consistent One Responders, or Consistent Discriminators. Consistent Discriminators chose distance as magic and contact as electric. These children also discriminated in their action, using distance for magic. There was also an effect of age on children’s use of magic. Older children were more likely to invoke magic as an explanation.",en_US,Causal Reasoning,Plausible Explanations: Magical Causal Explanations in Preschoolers,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects participated in a DRM memory task that involved listening to lists of words and trying to recall them after study periods. Activation/monitoring theory has associative predictions of the DRM false memory illusion which emphasize that backwards associative strength values of the targets that subjects recall will be strongly related to whether subjects produce the unpresented critical distractor. Relations between inter-word associative strength (associative firing) and false recall were analyzed and the results illustrated that none of the associative theory's predictions are an outcome in the DRM illusion. Strong levels of false memory were found. The pleasantness condition had significantly larger amounts of true memory compared to the orthographic condition. There was a main effect for the memory factor such that targets were recalled more than critical distractors, and critical distractors were recalled more than other distractors.

In the reverse direction, the effect of behavioral experiences on subsequent expectations was also assessed.
 
Methods: Eight-hundred and seven adolescents (M=15.5 years, SD=1.0) completed a questionnaire that included questions about how far they expected to go in school, their perceived likelihood of getting (a girl) pregnant  in the next 6 months, contracting HIV/AIDS, and contracting an STD by age 25. Participants also answered questions about their recent engagement in a range of risk behaviors involving substance use, delinquency and sexual activity.  An identical questionnaire was administered at five time points over the course of one year.  Longitudinal modeling was used to assess the influence of pre-test expectations on subsequent risk behaviors, and conversely, the effect of pre-test behavioral experiences on subsequent expectations for education and health outcomes.  Sociodemographic variables and the criterion at baseline/previous time points were controlled for in all analyses.

Results:  Results showed variable support for the notion of negative/near-fatalistic expectations as predictors of later risky behavior.  A high expectation of teen pregnancy in adolescents proved a marker for involvement in health-jeopardizing behaviors. Pre-test judgments of pregnancy risk significantly predicted increased involvement in later behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, and number of sexual intercourse partners.  Reciprocally, these behavioral experiences at pre-test predicted subsequent perceived risk. Pregnancy expectations also significantly predicted increased truancy, unprotected sex, theft and vandalism; these behaviors were not predictive of pregnancy expectations.  Predictive effects were not seen as strongly or consistently for expectation measures involving educational (non) attainment, STD contraction and HIV/AIDS infection.  Notably, however, expectations for HIV/AIDS infection (both within 6 months and by age 25) predicted smoking and vandalism.  There was a positive reciprocal relationship between expectations for STD contraction (by age 25) and number of partners at multiple time points.  Risky behaviors tended to predict decreased educational expectations, but not vice versa.  Importantly, expectations did not always reflect current involvement in risk behaviors: risky sexual behavior often did not predict increased subsequent expectations for pregnancy, STD and HIV/AIDS contraction.  

Conclusion: Near-fatalistic expectations for the future do predict increased involvement in subsequent risk behaviors.  At-risk individuals may benefit from interventions that promote optimistic orientations for the future, risk-avoidant values, and self-efficacy.",en_US,longitudinal,The Perils of Pessimism: Predictive effects of negative expectations for future health and education outcomes on  adolescent risk behavior,Dissertation or Thesis,This item removed from eCommons on 2011-09-01 at the request of the author.

Eleventh grade students (n = 1,953) in 17 public schools across New York State were surveyed regarding their agricultural perceptions and stereotypes. Four types of schools were targeted for this study: rural and urban schools with agriculture programs, and rural and urban schools without agriculture programs. The purpose of this study was to determine perceptions among high school students about agriculture and careers in agriculture. Results indicated a lack of understanding regarding the importance of a college education for agricultural careers.  The agricultural perception scores of students attending a school with an agriculture program but not enrolled in an agriculture course were similar to the scores of students attending schools without agriculture programs; only the students enrolled in agricultural education courses had significantly higher perception scores. The demographics from the rural schools without agriculture programs indicated an opportunity may exist to expand agriculture programs within these areas. The majority of the population believed no specific individual, media, and/or environment influenced their perception; however those who indicated an influence held more positive perceptions of the field of agriculture.",en_US,agriculture,High School Students’ Perceptions of Agriculture and Agricultural Careers as Delineated by Presence of an Agriculture Program and Rural/Urban Categorization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent research has also shown that infants are able to use indirect emotional information (i.e. emotional cues directed at a third party) to regulate their behavior towards strangers and objects. However, all of this research has looked at how anger affects infant’s behavior. In my study, I looked at how 18 month old infants changed their behavior towards an object after seeing an adult researcher react with anger, sadness, or neutral affect. Infants were given a toy to explore and then an adult showed them one particular way to play with the toy. In response to this, another researcher (the emoter) reacted with one of the aforementioned emotions directed towards the accomplice experimenter, and demonstrated another way to play with the toy. Infants were then given back the toy and their imitative behavior was observed.  After doing this three times with three different toys, the emoter pretended to hurt herself on the way out of the room in order to test the infant’s empathetic response. This study hopes to address how infants change their behavior in response to an other-related emotion (sadness) as opposed to a self-related emotion (anger), which could have direct negative consequences for the infant. This could speak to how infant’s develop and act on sympathy as well as the possible mechanisms behind social referencing.",en_US,Sympathy,Differential Behavior Regulation in Infant Social Referencing and Implications for the Development of Sympathy,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here I examine a different approach using a target fish community analysis that efficiently reveals aspects of the ecosystem that are most important for site improvement. The target community is comprised of the relative proportions of fish species that should be at a location based on fish present in biologically similar reference sites considered to be ecologically acceptable. Comparison with the current proportions of species at the restoration site reveals specific objectives on which ecologists can focus in order to maximize restoration efforts. This study examines the effectiveness of target fish community analysis in the San Francisco Bay, the largest estuary on the Pacific coast, using four coastal estuaries: Columbia Estuary, WA/OR; Tillamook Bay, OR; Morro Bay, CA; and Santa Monica Bay, CA. Trawl data from South San Francisco Bay conducted by the Marine Science Institute in Redwood City, CA from 1970 - present were used for the comparison. Data revealed no changes in species abundances through time, and benthic species were consistently underrepresented relative to the target. In addition, pelagic Northern Anchovy were overabundant even though they were the most prevalent species in the target. I propose that the dominant Northern Anchovy benefits from eutrophic conditions and increasing food availability, which lowers benthic oxygen and results in lower fish abundance. In addition, toxins such as mercury and polychlorinated bisphenols buried in sediment could contribute to low abundances of benthic species. The study showed that restoration efforts should focus on eutrophication and sediment toxicity as important aspects of the San Francisco Bay that impact fish communities and that the target community analysis has great potential for systems with appropriate reference sites.",en_US,,Assessing the Restoration Needs of the San Francisco Estuary Using a Target Fish Community Analysis,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, they require information on biomass resources that are currently available so that these resources may be used efficiently in the production of electricity through cofiring in existing coal-fired power plants. This technology has the potential to utilize renewable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near future. This project seeks to estimate and map the supply of different sources of biomass through New York State in order to remedy the current lack of information available on this topic.  Herbaceous energy crops, represented by switchgrass, and short-rotation woody crops, represented by willow, are considered as potential alternative feedstocks. Supplies are estimated based on land potential, land constraints, economic factors, and power plant capacities. GIS is used to map these factors. Varied scenarios are analyzed and discussed to illustrate a range of potential outcomes. The least intensive production scenario predicts a potential supply greater than the cumulative capacities of all power plants for cofiring. All other scenarios predict that production can meet capacity in more concentrated areas near power plants. This study finds that New York State has the resources to cofire biomass at all of its coal-fired power plants in the short-term.",en_US,,Estimating the Potential Supply of Biomass for Cofiring in Electricity Production in New York State,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PGCs have been shown to differentiate into embryonic germ (EG) cells which can aggregate to form embryoid bodies (EBs) in vitro. EGs within EBs are capable of differentiating into a variety of cell types; thus EBs can be useful for generating large numbers of stem cells for regenerative medicine. The objectives of this study were to  harvest and culture primordial germ cells from indifferent gonads of the embryonic domestic chick and assess factors affecting survival, proliferation, and development of gonadal cells (somatic and germ) in vitro. PGCs were identified based on size and staining with pluripotent stem cell markers. Formation of cell aggregates, presumptive EB precursors, was observed throughout all gonadal cultures in the presence of PGCs. Gonadal cultures treated with busulfan to eliminate PGCs had only limited aggregate formation. Cultures supplemented with fibroblast growth factor showed increased aggregate formation.

Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and melanocortin 4-receptor (MC4R) are two genes expressed in neurons of the hypothalamus that are involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis in mammalian species. Re-sequencing of these two genes revealed a total of five synonymous SNPS; one in MC4R and four in POMC.  The MC4R SNP showed an association with body condition score (BCS) and a significant association with light and dark shades of coat color. Three of the POMC SNPs were located in coding regions. All three were synonymous. The last POMC SNP was located upstream of the coding region of the gene, and is potentially regulatory. Horses were genotyped for the MC4R SNP using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) technology and melting curve analysis. New sequence data was generated for POMC and four distinct haplotypes were identified within the gene. Comparisons between the protein sequences of the two equine genes and other mammalian species show a high amount of evolutionary conservation. Additional work should focus on elucidating the exact nature of the link between the MC4R SNP and coat color, gathering data on more horses to determine if there is statistical significance between the MC4R SNP and BCS, as well as work to determine if the regulatory mutation in POMC affects transcript copy number in the hypothalamus. Either gene could affect adiposity in the horse, which is a known risk factor for both EMS and laminitis.",en_US,laminitis,Polymorphism Identification and Association Analysis of MC4R and POMC Genes,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this process, sperm gain the ability to undergo acrosomal exocytosis whereby the release of proteolytic enzymes from the acrosome facilitates penetration of the oocyte vestments at fertilization; this is often used as a marker of capacitation. This study aims to investigate the signal transduction pathway leading to acrosomal exocytosis in stallion spermatozoa, particularly the role of soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY) and protein kinase A (PKA). In order to clarify their function in supporting this event in stallion sperm, we use the SACY-specific inhibitor KH7, and the PKA-specific activator 3´-5´ cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analog SP6. We add these agents to sperm incubated in capacitating conditions and compare rates of acrosomal exocytosis with those achieved after the addition of the agonists calcium ionophore (CaI) or progesterone, or control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). First, it was determined that inhibiting SACY has no effect on rates of acrosomal exocytosis when the inducer is CaI, but partially reduces rates when the inducer is progesterone, albeit not to control levels. The results suggest that some cAMP production by SACY is required for acrosomal exocytosis under physiological conditions, but there may be multiple pathways involved. Next, it was found that stimulation of PKA by a cAMP analog resulted in rates of acrosomal exocytosis sperm higher than rates achieved with DMSO, suggesting that it is a PKA-dependent process.",en_US,spermatozoa,Investigating the Role of Soluble Adenylyl Cyclase and Protein Kinase A in Acrosomal Exocytosis in Equine Spermatozoa,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is generally accepted that a number of factors play a role in the persistence and intensity of lake effect snow events, such as ice formation of the surface of the lake, but only recently has that relationship begun to be thoroughly examined. This observational study focuses on the impact of lake surface ice coverage on two lake effect storms that occurred downwind of both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario: “Jack Russell”, which occurred from February 19-20 2008, and “Jararaca”, which occurred from January 16-17, 2009. This study undertakes a graphical analysis of the lake surface conditions at the time as well as a mathematical study of the heat fluxes and total energy transfer interaction between the lakes and the atmosphere during the duration of the two lake effect events. The analysis identifies that Lake Erie, which is mostly ice covered, experiences a significant decrease in energy transfer as the event persists, while the relatively ice-free Lake Ontario experiences no significant change in energy transfer for the duration of the two storms. Graphical analysis indicates that the areas of heaviest and most persistent snowfall were experiencing wind fetches off the lake that had traveled over lake surface areas with minimal ice coverage and thickness, highlighting the influence of ice coverage and thickness on the development of lake effect bands.",en_US,,An Analysis on the Impacts of Ice Cover on Two Eastern Great Lakes Lake Effect Snow Events,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vertebrates, ILS is triggered not only by insulin but also by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs.) IGF-specific modulation of ILS is partially conferred through IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). In Drosophila, ILS is initiated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and is also modulated by an IGFBP homolog known as Imp-L2.  Specifically, Imp-L2 is upregulated when Drosophila larvae are starved and segregates the ILP in non-signaling complexes. This mechanism prevents ILS-dependent nutrient utilization and prolongs the lifespan of larvae during starvation. Interestingly, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses ILP and ILS, also prolongs its lifespan through decreased metabolism during periods of starvation or other chronic stresses (heat, crowding, etc.). However, it is not known whether ILS in the worm is modulated by an Imp-L2-like protein.  To resolve this issue, studies were performed to determine whether an Imp-L2-like protein exists in C. elegans, and whether it prolongs lifespan during periods of stress. Using the Imp-L2 amino acid sequence as a template, the zig-4, zig-3, and zig-2 genes were identified as possible Imp-L2 homologs in C. elegans. Next, RNAi techniques were used to assess the possible roles of the candidate gene products in dauer arrest, lifespan determination, and fat deposition. RNAi against zig-4 significantly lowered dauer arrest frequency in daf-2 mutants compared to the control RNAi (P<0.05), while RNAi against zig-3 and zig-2 had no significant effects on dauer arrest. RNAi against zig-4 also significantly shortened lifespan in wild-type and daf-2 mutants compared to the empty vector control RNAi (P<0.05), but these results were not consistent over several trials. These data are consistent with zig-4 attenuating ILP-dependent ILS and with zig-4 possibly encoding an Imp-L2 homolog in C. elegans.",en_US,lifespan,Investigating Insulin-like Peptide Signaling-Dependent Stress Resistance in Caenorhabditis Elegans:  Possible Modulation Through an Imp-L2-like Binding Protein,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, and application rate all had significant and interrelated effects on total maize biomass. In general, animal waste biochars increased biomass by up to 17%, while food waste biochar decreased biomass in relation to controls by 7 to 92%. Increasing the temperature from 300°C to 600°C decreased the negative effect of food waste biochar. The optimal application rate, regardless of feedstock or pyrolysis temperature, was 2.0% (w/w) (equivalent to about 26 t ha-1), indicating that an increased application past that point did not necessarily lead to increased yield benefits. However, several of the biochar treatments, such as poultry with sawdust and high production temperature corn stover, did lead to greater total biomass than the 140% fertilization controls. Feedstock, pyrolysis temperature and application rate deserve consideration prior to field application, as certain feedstocks can be have negative effects on yield.

An important characteristic of Rasgrf1 is the differentially methylated domain (DMD). The paternal allele is methylated and expressed while the maternal allele is unmethylated and silent. Another important element of Rasgrf1 is a set of 41 nucleotides repeated 40 times that is located immediately downstream of the DMD. The repeats have shown to be necessary for proper regulation of methylation within the DMD. Mouse Igf2r, a maternally imprinted gene in mice, has a region known as Intron 2 or Region 2 (R2) that controls methylation and imprinting. Mutant mice called Lu mice were designed with R2 in place of the repeats seen at Rasgrf1. R2 was partially effective in taking the place of the repeats allowing the methylation and expression of the paternal Rasgrf1allele. For the most part, Lu mice had proper methylation of the paternal allele as seen in wild type mice, but the normally unmethylated, unexpressed maternal allele was activated in trans and aberrantly expressed. This phenomenon is similar to paramutation in corn that is mediated by RNA. In fact, an aberrant RNA was being produced in the mutated Rasgrf1 allele containing R2 and a recent study has data implicating that a piRNA pathway and DMD spanning RNAs may be controlling methylation. Whether or not the aberrant RNA is truly regulating methylation is unknown, but here in this study we sought to characterize the RNA to gain further clues.

Much is known about the motor and electrical behavior of mormyrids in the initial phase of dominance, but much less is known about the second phase.

In addition to these classical roles, one current hypothesis posits that deregulated adult stem cells may in fact be the origin of cancer-initiating cells. Within the epidermis, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) give rise to and maintain the hair follicle structure through a series of remodeling phases known as ‘hair cycles’. The transcription factor Runx1, also known as AML1, plays a role in the activation of HFSCs by prolonging the quiescent phase of the hair cycle when ablated. Coincidently, Runx1 is also translocated in 20-30% of patients afflicted with the blood-related disease acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we explore the role that Runx1 may have in skin tumorigenesis by using a mutagen (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, DMBA) and a phorbol ester mitogen (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, TPA) in a two-step, oncogenic protocol. First, we observe that epithelial-specific Runx1-mutant mice show decreased levels of phosphorylated Stat3 and acquire significantly fewer papillomas than their wild-type littermates in response to carcinogenic drug treatment, a phenotype which is reversed when the cell cycle regulator p21 is simultaneously knocked-out. Second, cells initially expressing Runx1 contribute to tumor formation. Lastly, induced removal of functional Runx1, which is up-regulated in tumors, following tumor formation actually resulted in a reduction in overall tumor volume. Taken all together, these results suggest that Runx1 functions upstream of p21 and is involved in not only the initiation of tumors, but also their proliferation and progression, possibly via the Jak/Stat pathway",en_US,,Runx1 Function in Mouse Skin Tumor Formation,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to pathogens that maintain a long-term feeding relationship with their hosts, i.e., biotrophs, is mediated by the salicylic acid (SA) pathway. However, resistance to pathogens that kill their host and feed on the dead cells, i.e., necrotrophs, is mediated by the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. RNA interference (RNAi) is also involved in plant-pathogen interaction.

The goal of our study was to determine the defense pathway involved in Arabidopsis thaliana non-host resistance to the hemibiotrophic (which has the potential to be biotrophic and necrotrophic) fungus-like pathogen, Phytophthora capsici. We tested the susceptibility of detached leaves and intact plants from a variety of Arabidopsis mutant and transgenic lines affected in the SA, JA and RNAi pathways, and in cell wall penetration. Our results showed that resistance to P. capsici is primarily mediated by the SA pathway. NahG transgenic plants, which degrade SA into catechol, were most susceptible to P. capsici in detached-leaf assays. Also, using Arabidopsis leaves from transgenic lines expressing pathogen responsive promoters fused to a GUS reporter, we demonstrated that SA-responsive PR-1 and PR-2 genes, rather than the JA-responsive PDF1.2 gene, were induced after the leaves were inoculated with P. capsici. Mutations in genes involved in RNAi, such as argonaute (AGO) and silencing defective (SDE) loci, did not hinder Arabidopsis’s defense against the pathogen.

One phytotoxin in particular, coronatine (COR), is the major determinant of spreading chlorosis in several pathovars of P. syringae. COR is composed of two moieties, coronafacic acid (CFA) and coronamic acid (CMA), linked via an amide bond. CFA is a polyketide and CMA is an ethylcyclopropyl derivative of isoleucine. Phytotoxins and type III effectors may have overlapping functions in virulence, and disentangling these functions is complicated by redundancy and linkage of their genes in horizontally acquired gene clusters. Here, the production of COR, as well as the resulting chlorosis phenotype, was shown to occur independently of the type III effectors, and with minimal bacterial growth within the host apoplast. The small ORF, PSPT04723, located within effector-gene cluster IX of DC3000, was shown to be necessary for the synthesis of COR due to its control over the production of CMA, but not CFA.

Plumpy’nut is patented and of simple design, Golden Rice is patented and scientifically complex, and Oral Rehydration Therapy has a simple structure and was never patented.

By comparing the cases of these three technologies, several preliminary conclusions were drawn. First, patents can slow the development, limit the supply, and increase the price of technological fixes and detract from their ability to effectively meet the health needs of children in the developing world.

Lineage III strains, associated most commonly with animal disease, have not been extensively studied. σB, a transcription factor encoded by sigB, has been shown to contribute to stress survival and virulence in L. monocytogenes. Recent studies have revealed that σB regulons have varied among strains, and that σB did not contribute to stress survival in one representative lineage IIIA strain. The purpose of this study was to determine if σB significantly contributes to acid and oxidative stress survival in two additional lineage IIIA strains of different serotypes. Two lineage IIIA strains, FSL F2-695 and FSL F2-525, had isogenic ∆sigB mutants made using allelic exchange mutagenesis. Those strains and a control lineage II lab strain, 10403S, with its ∆sigB mutant were subjected to acid stress at pH 2.5 and oxidative stress with 13 mM cumene hydroperoxide for 15 minutes. All three isogenic ∆sigB mutants had significantly higher acid stress death rates (p < 0.001) and oxidative stress death (p < 0.01) than their corresponding wild-type strains. FSL F2-525 exhibited a significantly higher acid stress death rate than the other wild-type strains. 10403S had significantly higher oxidative stress death than FSL F2-695. Consistent with strains in other lineages, σB is a significant factor in acid and oxidative stress survival in most lineage IIIA strains of L. monocytogenes.",en_US,,Investigating the σB Stress Response System in Two Lineage IIIA Strains of Listeria monocytogenes,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lake receives its effluents from a largely urbanized watershed that extends 381 Km2. With more than half of Guatemala City situated within the lake’s watershed, polluted runoff and sewage constantly get deposited into the lake, turning it into a dead, eutrophic body of water with such high contamination ratings that it is comparable to a sewage tank. The city is comprised of dense development, informal settlements, sprawling communities, agricultural farms, and 30% of the country’s total industry. Most people living on in this watershed don’t imagine that the untreated domestic waste that they dump into the river is partly to blame for the catastrophic degradation of Lake Amatitlan. The thick green microcystin bacteria that thrives in the lake consumes the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich domestic sewage, reducing its photic zone from an original 10 meters of depth to just 1 meter. The banks of the deforested gullies throughout the watershed are being eroded away by torrential rivers throughout the watershed, which then carry enormous sediment loads into the lake, lowering its depth of at an alarming rate.

This research characterizes the watershed of the lake, looks at the contaminants and issues affecting it, evaluates remediation strategies currently being used and suggests alternative strategies based on ecological restoration design. These new strategies inspired by case studies of effective modern practices for filtration, remediation, management and environmental education. These contemporary practices will help inform how to apply specific strategies that will address the causes of pollution at its source. Additionally, the design of a reconstructed wetland near the lake will demonstrate how natural processes can be used to filter polluted effluents and provide habitat for underrepresented fauna and flora. This proposed wetland will become a park that provides an educational and aesthetically pleasing environment where people can enjoy nature and take part in an emerging green movement in Guatemala.",en,,Green Movement Against Green Water,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,Using Green Infrastructure Strategies in the Lake Amatitlan Watershed to Promote Environmental Education in Guatemala,,,,,,,,,,,,

Romantic attachment strength, romantic relationship satisfaction and romantic relationship length were all strong predictors of shopping behavior but only in the acquaintance condition. Participants whose partner representations were activated, relationship length was associated with increased impulsive and decreased exploratory shopping behavior. In contrast, for participants who were asked to think about an acquaintance, romantic relationship length predicted more exploratory and less impulsive shopping behavior.

These payments are significantly affected by the CEO's characteristics, firm size and whether the CEO is retained but appears to be unrelated to measures of performance. I find that retained CEOs are more likely to negotiate for additional gains but their success rates are dependent on the positions they occupy in the combined company.

In order to address this problem, several state-level programs have been started and made available to any child with an ASD diagnosis. One such program, the Ohio Autism Scholarship Program (ASP), started providing up to $20,000 per year for families with formally-diagnosed ASD children to purchase
services at any program-approved facility in 2004. The literature finds that programs relying on an ASD diagnosis for funding or services have the ability to influence diagnostic conclusions.
This analysis builds upon these largely observational studies by quantifying the impact of one such diagnosis-dependent autism resource – the Ohio ASP - on autism rates. Currently, Ohio ASP funding can be utilized in roughly half of Ohio counties where approved providers exist. In order to determine whether changes in autism rates are attributable to the Ohio ASP, I
perform both state and Ohio county difference-in-difference regression analyses controlling for general autism trends over time. At this time, it appears that the impact of the ASP on autism rates is insignificant or inconclusive. This is important to note for stakeholders who are concerned that such financial incentives may lead to false-ASD diagnoses and, in turn, strain the resources available for the children most in need of them.",en_US,Honors Thesis,Financial Incentives and Autism Diagnoses: An Ohio Autism Scholarship Program Case Study,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  Previous issue date: 2011-05",,,,,,,,,,"Though it was previously thought that the birth of new neurons stopped after development, we now know that neurogenesis continues throughout life in some areas of the brain (i.e. the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus). Learning, in particular, has been shown to facilitate the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus. The endocannabinoid system, famous for its activation by the illicit drug cannabis (marijuana), is known to play a role in learning as well as both developmental and normal adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This study aimed to test whether the role of the endocannabinoid system extends to the specific neuronal survival that is induced by learning. Fifteen male Long-Evans rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (a marker for newborn cells; BrdU), implanted with hippocampal injection cannulae, and trained on a hippocampal-dependent odor discrimination learning task while being infused with either rimonabant, which effectively blocks the endocannabinoid system, vehicle (DMSO), or saline control. After the rats were sacrificed, brains were removed and newborn cells were visualized using immunohistochemical labeling of BrdU. Our behavioral results show that rimonabant rats tend to learn slower than saline control rats but no slower than the DMSO vehicle controls. This may imply that our vehicle impairs learning such that any effect of the CB1 antagonist cannot be distinguished. Though there were not enough subjects for formal statistical tests, preliminary histology data shows that vehicle, rimonabant, and saline rats have the most to least new cells numerically. It turns out that DMSO can cause neural damage and therefore may have led to gliosis and resulted in inflated cell counts. Future studies should continue to explore the questions of this study using a different vehicle, a larger sample size, and fluorescent double-labelling for neurons.",en_US,extinction learning,The Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Learning-Induced Neurogenesis,Paper or Project,,,,,,"Athilingam, Jegath",2011-05,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, there is a growing psychological literature regarding the health benefits of expressing oneself through language, and how individuals differ in communication styles and narrative construction. This study aims to bridge these two emerging fields of empirical investigation. To date, no lines of research have been explored to assess the explicit influence of close relationships on how individuals express themselves using language. In the present study, participants were primed to think about a real life experience with a close other, or a casual acquaintance (as a control). They were then asked to perform a stream-of-consciousness writing exercise, describing their thoughts and feelings about their transition to college. The written texts were subjected to a word-count computer analysis program that searches for patterns of language belonging to various linguistic, psychological, and sociological categories. In participants' written responses, the prevalence of certain terminology significant to close relationships was found to be greater among those primed with a close relationship experience. Individuals' close relationship styles, as measured through questionnaires, moderated this effect. The implications of these results can potentially inform relationship counseling, strategies for effective interpersonal communication, and contribute to the already established tradition of using writing as a form of psychological catharsis.",en_US,Narrative,A Language of Love: The effect of social primes on written narratives,Paper or Project,,,,,,"Bowen, Jeffrey",2011-05,,,,,,,,,,

This division is especially apparent in the debates surrounding the possibility of universal health care given the passage of the new health care reform bill this past year. Converging evidence from historical and psychological accounts of ideology suggest that differences in thinking styles are associated with ideological differences. Given their importance as a unique political cohort, as well as known age differences in information processing styles and executive functioning, older adults (N=86) completed self report measures and a verbal fluency task to elucidate the relationship between information processing styles, executive function, political ideology and support for universal health care over the period when the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was debated and then passed. We found that older adults' political beliefs formed cohesive ideologies along a liberal/conservative spectrum. Ideology significantly accounted for differences in party support for increased government funded healthcare, whereas understanding of the health care bill had no effect on participant support of the bill. We also found that preferences for rational thinking styles and maintained executive functioning were associated with liberal ideology in older adults.

Research indicates that individual differences in impulsivity are highly correlated with adolescent risk taking (Verdejo-Garcia, Lawrence, and  Clark, 2008). Fuzzy-Trace Theory, a dual-process theory, proposes that differences in decision-relevant information processing predict decision outcomes (Reyna and  Brainerd, 1995). Gist-based reasoning relies on qualitative information processing that emphasizes the abstract meaning of decision alternatives (e.g., avoid risk), whereas verbatim-based reasoning represents a form of quantitative, literal information processing (e.g., the specific risk of getting pregnant). Research suggests that gist processing is risk preventing, whereas verbatim processing is risk promoting (Mills, Reyna, and  Estrada, 2008). The present study examines whether positively-valenced gist processing of decision-relevant information (e.g., approach risk) can account for the information processing of highly impulsive adolescents. Participants were 929 (28% male) late-adolescent students (mean age 19.7 years) recruited from undergraduate classes at Cornell University. They were administered an online survey with self-report measures of gist and verbatim processing associated with sex- and alcohol-related risk behavior, self-report measures of different facets of impulsivity, a delay discounting task, and a measure of real-world risk taking behavior. Results show that positive gist and impulsivity measures are positively associated with sex- and alcohol-related risk behavior. Mediation analyses suggest that positive gist is a significant mediator between impulsivity and risk behavior. The results indicate that positive gist is an important correlate of adolescent risk behavior and a significant mediator of the association between impulsivity and risk taking.",en_US,gist-based reasoning,Gist for Risk: Link between Impulsivity and Fuzzy-Trace Theory Explanations of Adolescent Risk Behavior,Paper or Project,,,,,,"Romer, Adrienne",2011-05,,,,,,,,,,

However, environmental factors such as high quality caregiving could be protective against these biological risks. Longitudinal data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being was used to assess the relationship between difficult temperament and risk for neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy and outcome behavior problems and executive function five years later. Quality of caregiving these children received at both ages was measured. Change in caregiving quality was tested as a moderator in difficult temperament predicting behavior problems, and risk for neurodevelopmental impairment predicting executive function. It was hypothesized that increases in the quality of caregiving would result in (a) fewer problem behaviors based on initial measures of difficult temperament, and (b) better than expected executive function outcomes based on initial risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. Difficult temperament was found to predict problem behaviors 5 years later. Similarly, risk for neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy was found to predict lower executive functioning 5 years later.

Corresponding optical absorbance at 650 nm and concentration data, based on viable cell plating, were collected for Alpha and MCW strains of O. oeni over time. This data was used to estimate viable cell concentrations and timing of growth phases for each strain using optical density measurements. Each stain was grown up to late stationary phase, washed and resuspended in buffer. Cells were then diluted to concentrations of 107 cells/mL, 106 cells/mL, 105 cells/mL, 104 cells/mL, 103 cells/mL, and 102 cells/mL and placed in a buffer that did not support growth. Malic acid was added, and samples were taken every half hour for four hours and analyzed for malic acid concentration by enzyme assay. This was repeated with cells that were harvested at the early exponential, mid exponential, late exponential/early stationary, and late stationary phases of growth adjusted to cell concentrations of 107 and 106 cells/mL. Results indicated that both strains performed malolactic fermentation from mid exponential to late stationary phase and that there was malolactic fermentation activity at both low and high concentrations (102 and 107 cells/mL).

This set of studies was conducted to determine the amount of variation for inulin content in wheat, the trait’s heritability and the level of environmental effects on this trait, and to find quantitative trait loci for inulin content. Amongst 87 varieties, inulin content ranged from 0.04% to 1.46% of dry weight with a median value of 0.70%, demonstrating that there is significant genetic variation for inulin content. When 20 varieties were grown in 6 different locations, inulin content was found to have a low heritability (H2=0.198999), and GxE effects were a significant factor in predicting inulin content. From a population consisting of 101 doubled-haploid lines created from a cross between AC Reed and Grandin, composite interval mapping detected major QTLs on chromosomes 2BL-2 and 5BS which explained 20.15% and 15.28% of the variation for inulin content, respectively.

The second part documents the site in its extant condition, focusing on its specific landscape characteristics that portray the site’s significance as well as its shortcomings. The historical documentary information was assembled from a variety of primary and secondary sources including historic maps, photographs, correspondence, reports, environmental assessments, written histories, and past studies conducted on the site.

Subjects (N=40; age20-50y) working on a tea estate in West Bengal, India participated in the study. Each subject wore an Actigraph accelerometer, Polar heart rate monitor and Cosmed K4b2 indirect calorimeter during a 90-minute period to assess minute-by-minute physical activity (PA), heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE), respectively. The testing period was meant to replicate a normal tea plucker’s work day which included 2 periods of rest, 3 periods of picking while carrying weight (0, 5, and 10kg) and 3 periods of walking while carrying weight (15,20, 25kg). An EE prediction equation was generated using a branched method that first distinguishes time during normal workday activities (picking, walking, resting) using accelerometer counts. Resting EE was estimated from age and weight, while minute-by-minute non-resting EE was estimated from HR and BMI. Rather than creating individually calibrated curves for each subject, individuals can be grouped based on BMI categories (<18.5, 18.5≥BMI≤24.5, >24.5) to predict EE during the work day. Predicted EE will be used to evaluate the efficiency of performing work (weight of tea plucked/kcal EE) relative to iron status in an independent sample of 248 tea pluckers.

The transcripts of 43 convicted predators were spliced into three equal sections according to word count and a computerized text analysis was performed to look at the different types of language that are expected in each stage based on grooming. The results reveal that predator language differs significantly throughout the three stages of grooming, and that the grooming stages can predict language patterns that are used most frequently in each stage.

The relationship of these volcanic rocks to the Baikal Rift Zone (BRZ) and the extent to which these lavas are involved in, or derived from, rifting has important implications for lithospheric development of Mongolia and Central Asia.

Enrichment in fluid-mobile elements (e.g. Sr and Ba), lower La/Nb ratios, and a calc-alkaline trend suggest that hydrous minerals may have contributed to the melt. Nb enrichment (>35 ppm), along with the melting of hydrous minerals, may be attributed to the melting of a metasomatically enriched lithospheric mantle source.

Mpl is made as a zymogen of ~55 kDa and is composed of a propeptide and a catalytic domain. Mpl maturation occurs by autocatalysis in a pH-dependent manner. To better understand the mechanism of Mpl autocatalysis, we aimed to purify Mpl for structure/function analysis. Mpl was purified in its natural host, L. monocytogenes, grown under conditions that favor the expression of Mpl, and the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation and filtration. Secreted proteins, including Mpl, were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in water, and passed through a buffer exchange column to eliminate the salt. Mpl was purified by ion-exchange chromatography at pH 7.0, and eluted from the column at 500 mM NaCl. It was further purified via Flag-tag affinity chromatography. Fractions containing Mpl were identified by Western immunoblot with an anti-Mpl antibody, and Coomassie Blue staining of protein gels was used to verify purity.

However, the use of eminent domain has become increasingly controversial because it has also been used for more discretionary projects, such as recreational trails. 

The purpose of this study was to gain insight on public opinion of the use of eminent domain for Phase Two of the Cayuga Waterfront Trail in Ithaca, NY. A secondary purpose was to observe how opinions of eminent domain differ across demographic groups. A telephone survey of a listed sample of 250 Ithaca residents was administered through the Cornell Survey Research Institute. 

Results indicate that Ithaca residents support the use of eminent domain both in theory and in accomplishing Phase Two. Residents favored eminent domain in general and for Phase Two by a ratio of about 5 (in favor): 3 (opposed): 2 (undecided). Younger to middle-aged people who hold at least a bachelor’s degree were most apt to favor the use of eminent domain. In general, those who favored eminent domain in theory also approved of eminent domain for Phase Two, and vice versa.

The study demonstrates strong community support for the use of eminent domain for Phase Two.

However, evidence for its role is contentious. This study examined the influence of testosterone on aggression but also aimed to further explore the effect of previous social stimuli on the outcome of male-male fights. Experimental males were exposed to animal stimuli (males, diestrus females, or estrous females) through a mesh barrier, and then testosterone levels were measured. The following day, control males with no prior exposure fought experimental males, and fighting behavior was recorded. It was hypothesized that exposure to social stimuli, especially exposure to estrous females, would induce testosterone surges in males. These surges would increase aggression in fights, thereby improving fighting ability in males with prior exposure. It was predicted that higher aggression would translate into experimental males winning significantly more fights than their control counterparts. However, results were rather ambiguous. A significant testosterone surge in males was only found after exposure to diestrus females. Males exposed to estrous females exhibited nearly significant testosterone surges, whereas males exposed to other males showed no significant changes in testosterone. The significant testosterone rise in males exposed to diestrus females did seem to increase aggression during fights compared to males with only male exposure. However, this did not predict the outcomes of the fights as expected.",en_US,,"Effects of Social Stimuli on Testosterone, Aggression, and Fighting Behavior in Male Golden Hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus)",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ostracods show high microhabitat specificity and complex extracellular species-specific luminescent courtship displays, which result in a symphony of firework-type displays over shallow Caribbean reef systems after nightfall. Each ostracod’s mating signal consists of a train of light pulses composed of an initial slow “call phase” and a terminal targeting “trill phase” of regular, more rapid and shorter, narrowly spaced pulses. Ostracod displays play a crucial role in sexual selection and therefore speciation in this group. We examined which characteristics of these displays might be used by individuals among three clades of luminescent Caribbean ostracods (Photeros-group, Kornickeria-group and ‘H’-group, based on morphological and molecular work) to differentiate conspecifics from other species. We hypothesized that the more variable initial phase characteristics used in species recognition are more important in shaping the evolution of Caribbean ostracods than those characteristics that make up the constrained trill phase. We combined frame-by-frame analyses of videos of displays from the field for two undescribed species with analyses of 22 species based on published data. We overlaid our findings onto an independently derived phylogeny based on molecular and morphological data of 14 of these 24 species to determine possible signal evolution patterns. Our findings suggest phylogenetic signatures in 5 aspects of the display signal: the duration of the complete signal train, duration and length of the initial phase, the number of pulses in the trill phase, and the amount of time between consecutive pulses in the trill.",en_US,signaling,The Evolution of Luminescent Courtship Signals in Caribbean Ostracods,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common factors responsible for triggering laminitis are intake of excess grain or exposure to lush pastures where high starch rich diets are consumed, although the connection between the gut and the hoof is not well understood. When horses are fed starch rich diets, like grain commonly found in the diets of race and performance horses, the balance of microbial species present in the digestive tract of the horse become disturbed, leading to lactic acidosis in the horse. The objective of this study was to identify and quantify the fecal microbial populations in horses maintained on various diets. Microbial populations present in the equine hindgut were assayed by using bacterial ribosomal DNA fragments present in fecal samples. Identification and quantification of specific bacterial species, using bacterial primers and florescent probes, can be detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). This study focused on equine hindgut streptococcal species (EHSS), including Streptococcus lutetiensis, which accounts for approximately 70% of the microbiota present in the hindgut prior to the onset of laminitis. Our results suggest that avoidance of pasture for all laminitic prone horses may need to be reevaluated as the hindgut microbe sensitivity to diet is unique for each individual horse. The use of these assays will be valuable in future work exploring the changing microbial populations present in the equine hindgut.",en_US,,Changes in Fecal Microbial Populations in Horses Maintained on Various Diets,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard treatments like surgical resection and chemotherapy are marginally effective. Despite aggressive therapy, the disease ultimately recurs. Local control-released chemotherapy may be administered via carmustine (BCNU) polymer-loaded biodegradable wafers (Gliadel® wafers) to the cavity upon surgical resection. One significant limitation of this modality is the instability of BCNU in aqueous media. Moreover, the effective therapeutic distance of the wafers extends only a few millimeters from the resection cavity, while recurrences occur often centimeters away. New carriers and pharmacological agents are being actively explored. One such carrier is derived from a novel set of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide-b–ethylene glycol-b-DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) thermo-gelling tri-block copolymers capable of sustained release of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel has been shown in vitro and in vivo to be effective against glioma cells while having a much slower degradation rate than carmustine; this slower degradation rate may allow deeper penetration into the brain, and as a result, effective concentrations can be sustained for longer periods. We seek to test whether thermo-gelling hydrogel carriers of paclitaxel could result in novel therapies for the treatment of GBM. We also seek to optimize the configuration of the thermo-gelling hydrogels within the resection cavity to maximize drug delivery to the surrounding brain.",en_US,,Optimization of Novel Thermo-gelling Tri-block Co-polymeric Carriers for the Delivery of Paclitaxel for the Treatment Glioblastoma Multiforme,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serotonin (5HT) plays an important role in enabling CPG functionality. All serotonergic input to the lumbar cord descends from the medullary Raphe nuclei; these inputs are lost after a complete spinal cord lesion. We used immunohistochemical methods to determine whether spinal cord injury (SCI) affects the expression levels of 5HT2C receptor clusters and CaV 1.3 channel clusters. Quipazine is a 5HT2 agonist and its regular administration has previously led to partial locomotor recovery. We sought to determine if daily administration would reduce the SCI-induced homeostatic changes in 5HT2C receptor and CaV 1.3 channel levels. Half the SCI mice were treated with quipazine, and half were saline vehicle treated. A combination of ImageJ and Matlab was used to determine the number, size, and intensity of 5HT2C receptor clusters after SCI, as well as the percentage of the frame area covered by CaV 1.3 channels and their average brightness. After SCI, there is a significant upregulation in the number of 5HT2C receptor clusters, and 5HT2C receptor clusters are significantly larger. Neither is reduced by quipazine. There is no significant change in the average brightness of 5HT2C receptor clusters after SCI. Additionally, the area and intensity of CaV 1.3 channels are significantly larger in SCI/saline mice than in intact mice.

This study hypothesized that deuterium may have also increased over time due to temperature increases caused by climate change.  Deuterium was investigated in avian museum specimens from the last century in Tompkins County, New York.  Specimens were chosen using two different criteria: one including a wide variety of species to investigate general trends and the other restricted to a few species to reduce noise in the data.  Across a wide variety of passerine species, δD demonstrated an increasing trend over time, but the explanatory power of time was low (r2=0.1134).  When analysis was restricted to a single species, this relationship disappeared.  The relationship between temperature and δD rarely explained more than ten percent of the variation in the data.

Focusing on the biological raft region, (Lo+Lα coexistence phase), reduction in the size of the coexistence region was found, thus verifying the notion that SOPC is more miscible with DSPC and cholesterol than is DOPC. DOPC replacements greater than 70% resulted in a disappearance of the coexistence region leading to a suspicion that the phase domains were too small to observe using optical fluorescence microscopy.

This thesis investigates the mutant allele Chaos3 (chromosome aberrations occurring spontaneously 3) isolated in a N-ethyl- N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen of mice for chromosome instability. This mutation causes high levels of chromosome instability. Over 80% of mutant female homozygous mice develop mammary adenocarcinomas with a mean latency of 12 months.

The Chaos3 mutation occurs in the Mcm4 gene (minichromosome maintenance 4) and causes a single amino acid change (F345I) in a highly conserved region. Mcm4 encodes the MCM4 subunit of the hetero-hexameric MCM2-7 complex. MCM2-7 is a DNA replicative helicase. During DNA replication, MCM2-7 is loaded on the replication origins as double hexamers.

The goal of this study was to characterize the biochemical consequence of the point mutation, focusing on protein interactions measured by co-immunoprecipitation. Here, we report that the Chaos3 mutation causes a dramatic decrease of MCM4-MCM6 interaction and a slight decrease of MCM4-MCM7 interaction. This finding suggests that the loss of interaction might cause structural instability of the replicative machinery, leading to increased number of stalled replication forks and chromosome segregation defects.

Cameroon and Senegal serve as fruitful locals to investigate these questions, as the former represents a more pluralistic society while the latter is predominantly Muslim. Findings suggest that religion continues to mediate women’s relative control in different arenas of household decision-making, including family planning.

Across many taxa Ne is one tenth smaller on average than the census population size because of overlapping generations, uneven sex ratios, and other demographic factors that increase the variance in reproductive success. Organisms that experience high fecundity, external fertilization, and larval dispersal, like the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), are hypothesized to experience “sweepstakes reproduction”, or a high stochastic variance in reproductive success among individuals, resulting in a much lower Ne relative to Ncensus. Here the objective was to further test the sweepstakes hypothesis by estimating Ne in oyster populations using two distinct, direct measures. Temporal samples of C. virginica from two eastern Florida localities were genotyped for nine microsatellite loci to estimate Ne. Effective population size was estimated using two methods, a two sample moments-based temporal estimation and a single sample linkage disequilibrium estimation. Results from both methods are consistent with Ne between 500 and 10,000. These values are similar to past studies indicating a sweepstakes reproduction hypothesis, although not as extreme of a sweepstakes reproduction as some past work has suggested. However, predicted differences for allelic diversity and Ne were not detected between cohorts of spat (early juveniles) and local adults, preventing a strong conclusion that C. virginica is in fact experiencing sweepstakes reproduction based upon the tested indicators in this study.",en_US,,Estimating the Effective Population Size of Crassostrea virginica,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process intends to reveal to what degree each memorial exemplifies this definition of the experiential memorial. Research strategies included the author’s personal experience narrative, observations, photography and face-to-face interviews with visitors. Findings from this interaction, as well as interviews with knowledgeable individuals connected to each memorial, then informed a comparison of both memorials and suggestions for the design of future memorials.

This suggests that a text message serves as a purer prime to activate the idea of a supportive other, which includes the qualities that are most relevant to the task at hand. In comparison, the prime of a physically co-present friend may elicit a broader array of qualities that might or might not be useful to the task at hand, thus diluting the effectiveness of the prime overall.",en_US,,Can a Text Message Influence Our Perceptions of the Physical World?: Text Messaging as a Prime for Social Support,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be extremely useful in making short-term predictions about the impact that a thunderstorm may have on a localized area, allowing people to prepare for an approaching storm. In order to assess the accuracy of the Storm Prediction Forecast algorithm within the SCIT, 48 storms in New York and 24 storms in Kansas were chosen and the error between their forecast tracks and their actual paths was determined. These regions were chosen to look for any significant differences in algorithm performance in two disparate geographical regions and to include a region of the U.S. for which the SCIT algorithm has not been previously evaluated. The storms were chosen based on their severity, all being tornadic at some point during their lifespan. The Storm Position Forecast algorithm acts to predict positions for an identified cell in 15-minute intervals, out to a maximum of 60 minutes. To verify that the algorithm improves with time with respect to a given storm cell, successive scans were also analyzed to verify an improvement in the forecast tracks. Once the errors for each position forecast were calculated, comparisons were done between several different parameters to search for correlations with the errors, including distance to the radar station, dBZ value, lead-time, year and time of day. The errors were broken down further based on direction - where a storm went versus its projection. The most outstanding result discovered was in the separation of error into individual directions. For both the New York and Kansas storms, there was a prominent trend for the storm’s actual path to be to the right of the projected path. The reason for this preferential rightward error can only be hypothesized here and would be an area for further research.",en_US,,Evaluation of the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking Algorithm used by the WSR-88D,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In case of apple cider MF, suspended solids (plant cell wall materials, proteins, and polyphenols) are the main contributors to fouling.  In this study, the effect of turbidity, an indicator suspended solids quantity, and the membrane pore size on the flux in MF of apple cider was investigated.  Raw apple cider experiments ran in a pilot-plant scale MF unit equipped with ceramic membranes of 1.4μm, 0.8μm, and 0.45μm pore sizes, varying turbidity levels, at 6C, 5m/s crossflow velocity and 159 kPa transmembrane pressure.  The permeate flux measured MF efficiency; physical-chemical properties of the cider and microfiltered juice evaluated product quality.  Significant changes in pH, Brix and viscosity were observed only for cider microfiltered with 0.45μm. At high turbidity, the 1.4μm and 0.8μm membranes resulted in similar permeate final flux (65L/m2h), relative flux decline of 72%; while 0.45μm had the lowest final flux (37L/m2h), relative flux decline of 55%.  At low turbidity, 1.4μm, 0.8μm, and 0.45μm resulted in comparable final fluxes (49, 52, 53L/m2h, respectively) and relative flux decline of 61%, 64%, 55%, respectively.  The smallest pore size resulted in the highest rejection of particles and lowest flux, but the lowest flux decline; while the largest pore size had a higher flux, but more pronounced flux decay. This suggests that the fouling layer differs at different pore sizes.  Thus, membrane pore size and pre-filtration are critical for MF efficiency and can optimize this process for commercial applications.",en_US,,Effect of Turbidity and Membrane Pore Size on Cross-flow Microfiltration of Apple Cider,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These marks have varying effects on the expression state of a gene at different points in development and life. However, there is evidence that these modifications do not act independently, and that interaction between epigenetic marks is necessary for proper cell function. Our previous study showed mutual antagonism between two epigenetic marks, histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation (DNAme), upstream of the Rasgrf1 gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. H3K27me3 is deposited on chromatin by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), and was shown to both restrict and be restricted by the placement of DNAme at this locus. Here, I look at the methylation profiles of DNA from wild type mouse ES cells and ES cells with a mutation in Eed of the PRC2 complex that results in a global loss of H3K27me3 to determine if this mutual antagonism occurs genome-wide. Using a combination of a Methyl DNA Immunopreciptiation microarray and sodium bisulfite sequencing, I show that H3K27me3 does indeed influence DNAme at numerous promoters in the embryonic mouse genome. Instead of seeing a consistent increase in DNAme after loss of H3K27me3 however, I found that only some of these promoters showed DNAme enrichment, while others showed depletion in DNAme. Additionally, several genes were shown to have both DNAme enrichment and depletion in the same promoter. My findings suggest that mutual antagonism is not observed consistently genome wide, and that more complexity exists regarding the interaction between these two marks.",en_US,,Interdependency Between Two Epigenetic Modifications At Select Loci In Mouse Chromatin,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test if cooking at high altitudes is less effective at inactivating TI than cooking at sea level, common beans and fava beans were cooked in water at temperatures chosen to simulate boiling points at different altitudes.  In addition, each variety was autoclaved in water at 121°C to simulate a pressure cooker.  Trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) was measured with N-α-Benzoyl-L-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride, and in vitro protein digestibility was determined by digestion of samples with 3 peptidases.

Cooking common beans at 100°C inactivated 88.6% (SD±4.8) of TI, while cooking at temperatures between 87-97°C inactivated 73.2% (p<0.05).  In fava beans, TI inactivation was 75% at all cooking temperatures.  TI inactivation in an autoclave was positively correlated with time for common beans (p<0.05) but not fava beans.  Protein digestibility in common beans was 79.1% in raw beans, 85.0% in beans cooked at 87°C and 89.7% in beans cooked at 100°C.  Fava bean digestibility was greater than that of common beans when raw (86.0%) and when cooked at 100°C (95.6%).  Regression analysis showed a negative correlation between TIA and protein digestibility (r2=0.86).  Residual TIA of common beans cooked at high altitudes in boiling water is higher than when cooked at sea level, lowering protein digestibility.

Comprising two orders of freshwater teleosts, the Gymnotiformes and the Mormyriformes, weakly electric fish have evolved diverse electric organ discharges (EODs) that are used for electrolocation of objects and for sex- and species recognition, courtship, aggression, and appeasement, among other behaviors (Bullock 1982; Heiligenberb & Bastian 1984). Aside from the variety of EODs, the elements of electric communication that make it a model system include the presence of a highly specialized electrosensory system with a subpopulation of receptors and neurons dedicated to communication signal sensing, as well as the structure of the electrical signals themselves, which is relatively simple and amenable to study by experimental manipulation (Hopkins 1988). This paper presents the results of two studies on mormyrid fish and the electric organs (EOs) responsible for weak electrogenesis. In mormyrids, the electric organ is composed of four columns of serially stacked, dish-shaped electrocytes, two on each side of the spinal cord (Bennett 1970; Bass 1986). The central theme of this thesis is the relationship between electric organ morphology and EOD waveform. The first chapter presents a study of Paramormyrops kingsleyae that shows geographic variation in signals correlated with variation in electric organ anatomy. The second chapter is a descriptive study of larval and juvenile Brienomyrus brachyistius that identifies morphological correlates of EOD change in the course of development.",en_US,,Morphological Correlates of Signal Variation in Weakly Electric Mormyrid Fish,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  Previous issue date: 2013-04-12",,,,,,,,,,"Preppy, Ivy League, WASPy, Country Club—all are used synonymously as terms for the classic collegiate look of the early to mid-twentieth century American menswear that has since been popularized, commercialized, and hyped to excess. In 2010, the Japanese cult preppy style bible Take Ivy was printed in English for the first time. The iconic book documenting fashion at American Ivy League universities was originally published in 1965, and sparked a craze for casual Americana in the authors’ homeland of Japan. Studying fashion at an Ivy League school at the time of the book’s 2010 re-issue inevitably piqued my interest in the associated preppy phenomenon, and I began to look into “prep” in America. I found that its definition seems to remain consistent regardless of who is recounting it: conventionally clean-cut, yet just a bit lazy. 
“A list of articles in the Preppie wardrobe would be tedious, but the following are some of the more familiar items: LL Bean boots, Top-Sider moccasins, tasseled loafers; pure wool socks, black silk socks, no socks; baggy chinos, baggy brick red…trousers, baggy Brooks Brothers trousers, baggy boxer underpants; shirts of blue, pink, yellow, or striped Oxford, sometimes buttoned down, some made for a collar pin, usually from Brooks or J. Press…jackets of tweed, corduroy, poplin, seersucker with padless shoulders, a loose fit around the waist…a shapeless beige raincoat bleached by years of use and irresistant to rain” (Aldrich, 1996: 16) 
But beyond its unwavering characterization as a clothing descriptor, “prep” becomes blurry. The existing literature discussing preppy style tends to glaze over its actual origins and complex evolutionary history. Different sources attribute the beginnings of “prep” to institutes ranging from preparatory schools, Ivy League universities, and White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) society, and each declares the “golden age” of preppy fashion as a different decade spanning 1890-1970. In the recent Preppy: Cultivating Ivy Style, Jeffery Banks and Doria de la Chapelle wistfully describe “the windswept and privileged style known as preppy” as having “origins rooted in the grounds of the elite Ivy League universities of the 1920s, where young, WASPy, and wealthy gentlemen invented a relaxed new way for collegians to dress” (2011: 3). However, in her book discussing WASP style, A Privileged Life, Susanna Salk claims that it was born in the 1950s among the preparatory schools of the Northeast (2007: 106). The authoritative American Fashion Menswear alternatively contends that Brooks Brothers was the original proponent of preppy style during the years 1896-1930, along with the privileged elite college students attending Ivy League Universities who helped establish the most current trends in menswear. (Bryan, 2009: 83). These excerpts provide just a sampling of the confusing and contradictory arguments regarding the development of “prep.” 
Thus, the aim of this paper is twofold. First, I seek to clarify and substantiate the origins of prep style, its relationship with American collegiate culture and the national class structure, and its evolution as a fashion subculture. A great deal of writing analyzes the correlation between upper class society and northeastern universities, and some material also exists on the basis and popularity of preppy fashions in collegiate culture. However, the connection bridging these interactions is rarely discussed in the existing literature, or is only mentioned on a superficial level, with no apparent evidentiary support. Through a review of literature and historical materials, I will delve into the complex symbiotic relationship between these three aspects of American society (prep style, collegiate culture, and the upper class) as it developed throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Next, I strive to attain a clear understanding of the cultural and socioeconomic significance of preppy fashion at that time in history, its function as an essential arbiter of class for the American aristocracy. I will consider the modern relevance of this historically critical relationship by looking at the development of contemporary fashion marketing and commercialization, ethnographic observation of the modern university climate, and interviews with current college students. Through my research, I determine that the declining value of this style as an indicator of class in our society is a consequence of the dilution of “prep” fashion by mass media and merchandising in the fashion industry. However, I find that, while not as precise of a gauge as it once was, prep style remains relevant as a means of providing insight regarding the wearer’s socioeconomic status and aspirations.",en,Fashion,"The Origin and Evolution of ""Prep"" and its Socioeconomic Relevance",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions between hosts and pathogens create selective pressures—a cycle whereby hosts evolve novel defenses and alarm systems while their pathogen counterparts evolve enhanced weaponry and stealth tactics. Not uncommonly, plants lose the war against pathogens and succumb to disease. If a plant does survive a pathogen attack, it may be left with battle scars that reduce vegetative growth and fruit yield and quality. Without question, human survival depends on the abilities of plants to defend themselves against and survive pathogen onslaughts. With an increased understanding of plant immunity, humans will gain the ability to modulate and augment plant defenses to minimize disease and yield losses. Arabidopsis thaliana thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) family TOP1 and TOP2 metalloendopeptidases bind salicylic acid and may, therefore, play critical roles in plant immunity. Our research demonstrates that TOP1 and TOP2 regulate hydrogen peroxide accumulation, programmed cell death intensity, and possibly chloroplast integrity during the hypersensitive response following infection by the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. We hypothesize that TOP1 and TOP2 are central hubs in reactive oxygen species production and redox regulation, and, as such, may influence physiological responses during both abiotic and biotic stresses.",en_US,,Arabidopsis Salicylic Acid-Binding Metalloendopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 Regulate H2O2 Accumulation and Programmed Cell Death during the Immune Response against the Bacterial Pathogen Pseudomonas syringae,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, I describe the first systematic comparison of Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) Gag membrane binding properties using in vitro liposome binding assays, in vivo virus release assays, and localization studies using confocal microscopy of 293T cells. By doing so, I hoped to address two main questions. First, what drives EIAV Gag association with the plasma membrane? And second, why is EIAV Gag not myristoylated? My results showed that EIAV Gag membrane association is driven by electrostatic interactions and a preference for cholesterol-containing membranes. These results highlight the universal importance of electrostatic interactions for retroviral Gag PM targeting and may underline a shared association with lipid raft microdomains for budding. I also used EIAV matrix (MA) and HIV-1 MA mutants to confirm HIV-1’s dependence on myristoylation for virus release and localization to the plasma membrane. These same mutants have also led me to propose a model for EIAV MA helix 1 inhibition of myristoylation. Finally, a part of my thesis work has been dedicated to the development of a novel silica-bead binding assay to study protein-lipid interactions.

Locomotor CPGs are located in the spinal cord of all vertebrates. Interneurons have been shown to be a necessary part of regulating the coordination of the left and right flexor and extensor muscles that generate the normal walking movement. The V2a interneurons, in particular, play an important role in maintaining a left-right alternating hindlimb pattern at high speeds. Two key players of the CPGs are serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin transporters (SERT). 5-HT plays an important role in enabling the network to generate the locomotor rhythm in rodents, while SERT is responsible for high affinity uptake of 5-HT to terminate its activity in the synaptic cleft. Using double immunohistochemical methods, I determined that not only are 5-HT and SERT co-localized in 5-HT terminals, but also 5-HT and SERT–labeled terminals are located on V2a interneurons. Using Sholl analysis, I determined that SERT and 5-HT show similar co-localization patterns on the V2a interneurons. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) typically does not inflict physical damage to the cells that make up the hindlimb CPG, it results in a loss of motor function by removing descending input from the brain. This in turn can induce changes in CPG cellular activity and transmitter sensitivity. Thus, I sought to observe how SCI affects expression levels of 5-HT and SERT. After SCI, a loss of motor function occurs due to the changes in cellular activity and sensitivity in the CPG. Using single immunohistochemical methods, I determined that both 5-HT and SERT decrease significantly in area and intensity after SCI.",,Biological sciences honors program,Immunohistochemical quantification of serotonin and serotonin transporters in the lumbar region of the mouse spinal cord after spinal cord injury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate VU573 as a novel pesticide capable of inducing mosquito renal failure, electrophysiological analyses were carried out on isolated Malpighian tubules from the female yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Using the Malpighian tubule electrophysiology protocol developed in the laboratory of Klaus W. Beyenbach, exposure to 10µM peritubular VU573 was found to (1) hyperpolarize the basolateral membrane of isolated tubules by an average of 6.76 ± 1.27 mV (p<0.00012) and (2) increase cell input resistance by an average of 7.02 ± 1.31 kΩ (p<0.002) in conditions of potassium overload (34mM [K+] peritubular). These results confirm a block of A. aegypti Kir1 (AeKir1) expressed at the basolateral surface of stellate cells, which seem to be less involved in transport than their counterparts—the principal cells. Additional experiments establish that the 10µM VU573 dosage is equally as effective as the 50µM dosage (p=0.88). Furthermore, I-V plots taken of Malpighian tubules demonstrate that different tubules exhibit different degrees of rectification, from no rectification (Ohmic) to very strong rectification.
	The barium ion is known to strongly block all Kir channels. With the same protocol used for VU573, 5mM barium was tested and found to (1) hyperpolarize the tubule basolateral membrane by 11.91 ± 3.82 mV (p<0.008) and (2) increase cell input resistance by 123.58 ± 12.93 kΩ (p<0.0003). The much smaller resistance increase with VU573 compared to barium, coupled with the laboratory of Peter M. Piermarini’s finding of AeKir1 on stellate cells, suggests that AeKir1 channels are less involved with potassium transport and likely serve other functions, such as potassium sensing or cellular housekeeping. Taken in all, VU573 is effective at blocking AeKir1 but would need to be refined further to have an even more potent antidiuretic effect.",,Biological sciences honors program,The Effects of Small Molecule VU573 and Barium on Malpighian Tubule Electrophysiology of the Yellow Fever Mosquito Aedes aegypti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This prompted the question of whether the same pattern of selection observed in these two species was present in the germline stem cell genes of other Drosophila lineages?  The Aquadro Lab has been sequencing many germline stem cell genes in Drosophila species, and the answer to this question so far has been that some lineages show strong positive selection and some do not.  This observation led the Aquadro Lab to begin to test hypotheses about the driver – or drivers – of the positive selection in the germline stem cell genes across some Drosophila lineages.  One hypothesis proposed by Bauer DuMont et al. (2007) is that coevolution with pathogens such as the reproductive parasite, Wolbachia pipientis, infecting the germline could be driving this observed selection.  This project looked for signs of selection in the germline stem cell genes stonewall and otefin, two genes that have shown signs of positive selection in other Drosophila species, which the Aquadro Lab has previously tested.  These two genes were sequenced in Drosophila pseudoobscura, a species of Drosophila that is not currently known to be infected with Wolbachia.  This project shows that both genes do not show evidence of long term, repeated positive selection, but both genes do show evidence for a more recent selective sweep.",en_US,Biological sciences honors program,"Analysis of Selection Patterns in Germline Stem Cell Genes (Stonewall, Otefin) in Drosophila pseudoobscura",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, unprecedented mass emergence of chironomids have occurred around two of Singapore’s reservoirs, disrupting the lives of surrounding communities. Civic ecology practices would have been a valuable source of resilience toward this disturbance for these communities, because the practices would integrate individual, community, and environmental outcomes, through grassroots stewardship initiatives. However, civic ecology practices seemed to be absent among the communities. I observed public behavior around the reservoirs, as well as analyzed news articles, social media content, and government documents, to uncover social-ecological mechanisms underlying the nuisance issue. This allowed me to explain the lack of civic ecology practices, understand the potential of the reservoir social-ecological systems for adapting to the disturbance through civic ecology practices, and detect barriers to the emergence of those practices. I found that the initial conditions were not present for the emergence of civic ecology practices in those reservoir social-ecological systems, because the chironomid disturbance was not sufficiently disruptive. Nevertheless, the systems’ potentials lied in various resources related to government, technology, and cultural values. Barriers include negative assumptions about the chironomids and politicization of the nuisance issue.

The relationship between skeletal and muscle measurements was quantified and compared to the genotypic analysis of myostatin in the horse.    
	A sample of 101 Thoroughbred racehorses, from a variety of locations, was assessed using a previously published set of 35 body measurements.  An additional 8 Thoroughbred horses were examined using a recently developed set of muscle measures in order to better quantify the muscle mass of the animals.  In addition, photographs were taken of each individual horse (n=109), in order to assess the muscle conformation.  Hair samples were also collected for determination of MSTN genotype.  Photographs and MSTN genotype were then assessed and compared, prior to statistical analysis, in order to determine the existence and correlation between muscle conformation and the MSTN genotype.  Skewed measures, and failed genotypic analyses were eliminated from statistical analysis, resulting in a total of 86 individuals.         
	This study demonstrated that there is no direct correlation among conformation, body measurements, muscle measurements and MSTN genotype.  Horses with a polymorphism in MSTN do not exhibit phenotypic differences of the magnitude seen in MSTN alleles of cattle and dogs.  Subtle changes may be detected in future work with an expanded set of measures, larger population of horses, or by controlling environmental effects due to diet and exercise.
	The MSTN locus is currently used as a commercial marker of performance in the Thoroughbred although the physiological mechanism of its action is unknown.  This research has eliminated the possibility of gross effects on body size and conformation, though subtler changes in muscle mass may exist.  We expect future studies to further this exploration in hopes of determining why the MSTN polymorphism is not associated with altered body size or conformation in the equine species.",en_US,polymorphism,The Impact of Myostatin Genetic Polymorphism on Muscle Conformation in the Horse,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 105 Holstein cows from three farms in New York were analyzed. Blood samples, back fat measurements, body condition scores, lameness assessments, and records for body weight, milk yield, and disease occurrence were collected beginning approximately a week before parturition until thirty days in milk. Back fat and body condition scores were not correlated with each other and were not included in the final analysis. The associations between the interaction of each blood metabolite with disease and change in body weight and milk yield were stratified by parity and evaluated with the MIXED procedure in statistical software. All cows that developed disease experienced exacerbated weight loss and reduced milk production than healthy herd mates. Each parity group had a different indicator metabolite for faster weight loss (parity 1 = prepartum NEFA, parity 2 = BHB, parity 3 = postpartum NEFA), but calcium was not a reliable indicator for any group. Elevated prepartum NEFA and BHB levels were associated with reduced milk production for cows of parity > 2, while blood metabolites were only useful for heifers which concurrently developed disease.

This project aims to review the currently published optimal soil analysis ranges as well as to identify significant relationships between soil characteristics and yield which merit further investigation. Over the 2012 growing period, 106 production blocks in Dona Ana County were observed. Soil analysis was conducted on each block prior to budbreak and after harvest to review soil changes over the full growth cycle; yield and tree counts were also collected. Due to alternate bearing in pecans, yield has been analyzed in four population groupings: “ON” blocks only, “OFF” blocks only, all blocks using a two year yield average, and all blocks using a dummy variable to isolate the alternate bearing yield differences. Mixed regression models were used to identify optimal levels and significant relationships within all four groupings. Of the production blocks observed, the soil analysis results fell within only 22% of the published optimal ranges, which are not crop specific. Boron, Bulk Density, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, and Zinc were all identified as exhibiting significant, largely negative, relationships with yield, suggesting that these variables may be inhibiting production.

In this investigative study we used a combined proteomics and molecular virology approach to determine the identity and function of those plant proteins that are interacting with the readthrough domain of the RTP. Using a novel, on-plate co-immunoprecipitation method, we compared those plant proteins co-immunoprecipitating with the wild type form of PLRV with those that co-immunoprecipitate with a mutant form of the virus lacking the readthrough domain using N. benthamiana as a model system. Controls were thoroughly characterized to identify proteins that were non-specifically interacting with virus. Our research yielded four candidate proteins that appear to interact with the readthrough domain of the RTP and hence, are likely involved with phloem retention.

These four proteins were detected in the WT PLRV infected N. benthamiana as having 2.5-fold or greater enrichment as judged by spectral counts over a mutant that lacked the readthrough domain (ΔRTP) or control N. benthamiana tissue, and were also found in the host potato system with 2.5-fold or greater enrichment in WT PLRV infected potato as compared to healthy potato.

Objective: This paper examines the satisfaction of pregnant women with the weight management online intervention in the e-Moms of Rochester project and evaluates the satisfaction level by study arm and by demographic characteristic.
Methods: e-Moms of Rochester is a randomized controlled trial designed to help pregnant women achieve a recommended weight gain during pregnancy via an online intervention. The satisfaction survey was available online to the participants after their delivery. 942 out of 1512 pregnant women completed the satisfaction survey. Among the 942 participants, 621 women were in the intervention arm while the other 321 were in the control arm. The satisfaction level was measured on a 10-point Likert-scale from “0-strongly disagree” to “10-strongly agree”.  A score of 0-4 was counted as low satisfaction, 5-7 as medium satisfaction and 8-10 as high satisfaction. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for evaluating representativeness, satisfaction level across website features, and comparison of satisfaction by study arm and by demographic characteristic. 
Results: 70%-91.2% participants had a moderate to high satisfaction with different website features. However, 59.3% participants rated social support negatively. The Resources (mean=7.29) and Articles & FAQ (mean=7.28) had the highest satisfaction levels on helpfulness. The weight gain tracker was rated highest in terms of ease of use (mean= 8.35). The satisfaction levels of helpfulness of Resources and Reminder were significantly different by arm (p= 0.035; p= 0.002). Satisfaction levels for some website features were significantly different as well by demographic characteristic. 
Conclusion: Overall, participants felt satisfied with the project website except for the aspect of social support. The sections of Articles & FAQ and Resources were the most helpful. Weight gain tracker was the easiest to use in the intervention group. The intervention group had higher satisfaction level with Resources and Reminder. Pregnant women, who were low-income, young, Hispanic, African American or had a lower education level, were more satisfied with the website features.

  Previous issue date: 2014-04",,,,,,,,,,"Misfolded or unfolded proteins generated by inefficient protein folding or ER stress is translocated from the ER to cytosol for proteasome degradation, a process termed endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). OS9, a lectin protein, has been shown to deliver misfolded or unfolded glycoproteins to the most conserved ERAD complexes in the mammalian system, the Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD complex (Mehnert et al., 2010). Our study on OS9 shows that despite being an effector of the complex, OS9 itself is degraded by the same complex in response to ER stress. OS9 protein level decreases drastically upon the treatment of Tunicamycin (TM), Thapsigargin (Tg) or Dithiothreitol (DTT) . The addition of MG132 completely blocked the degradation, showing OS9 is degraded by proteasome. We then show the degradation of OS9 is abolished in Hrd1 knock-out (Hrd1-/- ) MEF cells, and significantly attenuated in Sel1L-/- cells when cells were treated with 6hr of cycloheximide (CHX), suggesting both Sel1L and Hrd1 are required for the degradation of OS9, but Hrd1 plays a more important role in the process. We also find that the protein level of OS9 is significantly higher in Sel1L-inducible knock out (IKO) mice than in WT mice, confirming that OS9 is degraded by Sel1L-Hrd1 complex in vivo. Using co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), we find that Sel1L associates with OS9 in a glycosylation independent manner and that it can be ubiquitinated by overexpressed Hrd1. In addition, our data suggest the protein stability of OS9 is mediated through the XBP1-Hrd1 axis. These data suggest that OS9 is degraded through the Sel1L-Hrd1 complex under ER stress. Not only does this study identifies a potential endogenous substrate of the Sel1L-Hrd1 complex, given the fact that OS9 is an effector of the complex, this study may also provide insights into a possible self-regulatory mechanism of the complex through regulating OS9.",en_US,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,Sel1L‐Hrd1‐Mediated OS9 Degradation During Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these diseases is Cryptosporidiosis, a common gastro-intestinal infection with currently no known treatments. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium. This parasite spreads through the environment as an oocyst, causing self-limiting diarrhea in healthy humans. These symptoms are often more dangerous in immuno-compromised individuals and children, whose immune systems are still developing. The rugged Cryptosporidium oocysts are able to survive treatment with most disinfectants. Thus, to prevent outbreaks, there must be early detection, followed by rapid treatment of the water supply and/or limited exposure to infected water supplies. Current methods of parasite testing for water samples are limited in their function by cost, access to materials, and ability to run equipment. Improvements in cost-effective, easy to use alternatives to traditional techniques, such as the use of lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (LSS) for DNA extraction and the loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method of amplification, will facilitate the detection of Cryptosporidium in the field and in impoverish nations.In this experiment, a five primer LAMP reaction was used in combination with the LSS reaction to eliminate otherwise essential electrical equipment in the detection process, expediting and easing in-field detection. The LSS was found to decrease the efficiency of the LAMP reaction, but its effects were mediated by changing the buffer used in the LAMP reaction. Amplicons were visualized using gel electrophoresis in this experiment. However, methods of detection were tested for incorporation into the test. These techniques will lead to the future of cost efficient detection of Cryptosporidium in water samples.",en_US,optimization,"Start to Finish Detection of Cryptosporidium for in Field Use on Water Samples via Lauroylsarcosine sodium Salt (LSS) Extraction, Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), and DNA Precipitation",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Behaviors associated with dispersal, such as novelty preference and exploratory behaviors, have been shown to be modulated by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in mice.  Whereas photoperiodic modulation of serum AMH concentrations in female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) has been demonstrated, novelty preference and exploratory behaviors have not been previously investigated in this species.  Through the manipulation of day length (DL) in Siberian hamsters, this study sought to determine if photoperiod-induced differences in serum AMH concentration correlate with behaviors that are associated with dispersal.  Although AMH was significantly different in males and females, and day length had a significant effect on AMH in males, our evaluations of novelty preference and exploratory behaviors revealed no effects of sex or photoperiod when evaluated at 21 days of age.  The information acquired from this study will contribute to the understanding and characterization of the associations among DL, AMH, and the behaviors associated with the dispersal of adolescent mammals.

The most well-known proteins that are encoded in this region are the MHC class I and MHC class II cell surface proteins.  These proteins are integral in producing the adaptive immune response.  Using polymorphic microsatellites within the MHC, MHC haplotypes were characterized from an extended Icelandic horse family of half and full siblings. The herd is composed of one stallion, fifteen dams, and three sets of foals from each dam.  A total of nine microsatellite loci were tested: two in the MHC class I region, two in the MHC class III region, and five in the MHC class II region. The Icelandic herd displayed a large degree of diversity in this region even though the population has been isolated and affected by bottleneck events in the past.  From the 32 possible unique haplotypes belonging to the one founder stallion and 15 mares, 26 unique haplotypes were identified.  A MHC recombination event occurred on one of the paternal chromosomes.  The stallion also exhibited segregation distortion in the distribution of the stallion’s MHC haplotypes inherited by the foals but not the sex ratio of the offspring.  These findings suggest that the Icelandic horse population has a greater degree of diversity in the MHC region than most other commonly studied horse breeds.  This diversity may come from a recombination mechanism that produces unique haplotypes by crossing over of existing haplotypes in the population at a higher rate than found in larger populations.  Another possible explanation would be that less favorable MHC haplotypes are allowed to persist in the less immunologically selective environment of Iceland.",en_US,Founding population,Identification of Major Histocompatibility Complex Haplotypes in Icelandic Horses,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observations were compared against a weighted average of nearby private-weather-station readings and Rapid Refresh [RAP]-model gridpoint forecasts for the corresponding time periods. Local nowcasts or forecasts for locations along the transects — generated from a similarity analysis of station and transect-location metadata — showed generally poor skill, though the consistently greater errors at higher elevations suggest the potential for fruitful additional adjustments beyond the scope of this study. A distinct reversal in the upslope wind corresponding to lapse rates near the moist-adiabatic value supports the hypothesis of a triggered hilltop cold-air pool. Nights with strong potential-temperature inversions had remarkably similar synoptic-scale conditions, which bore the hallmarks of a valley inversion being entrained from above by warm southeast winds. Bolstering this hypothesis was the definite linear relationship found between observed lapse rates and region-wide temperature trends on clear nights, but not cloudy ones. To better account for these findings, a new forecast scheme was then implemented, combining regressions of observed along-transect lapse rates on upslope winds, modeled open-sky lapse rates, and region-wide temperature trends; it demonstrated improved skill over the station-based one, suggesting that further work to enable standardization of microclimatic forecasts based on a simple set of externally measured variables would be both possible and productive.",en_US,radiation,"An Investigation of Microclimatological Conditions Along Elevation Transects Near Ithaca, NY",Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to isolate and identify microorganisms from compost and to address their potential as biodecaffeinators. Compost samples were obtained and then grown in nutrient broth.

The universal signaling event is an increase in calcium levels that occurs in the egg at this time.  In many cell types, calcium causes changes through a conserved signaling pathway by binding to a protein called calmodulin, which in turn regulates the activities of other proteins.  

Calcineurin, a phosphatase, is one of those other proteins.  It has been proven experimentally that calcineurin plays a critical role in regulating egg activation in fruit flies and in frogs.  For example, Drosophila females expressing a constitutively active calcineurin (cnA-act) in their germline are sterile.  To identify the proteins in the pathway by which calcineurin regulates egg activation, the Toshiro Aigaki lab tested whether there were Drosophila genes that interact genetically with calcineurin mutations. To do this, they searched for chromosomal regions whose deletion suppresses the sterility of cnA-act female flies.  Fourteen large chromosomal regions were identified.  

To define the precise gene(s) within each region that suppresses the sterility of cnA-act females, I have tested smaller deletions, and then individual mutations, within the five regions I am examining for interaction with cnA-act.  For three of the deletions, I have identified a gene or genes whose mutants significantly restore fertility of cnA-act females, and thus is a candidate to act within the calcineurin pathway.  The first is CG6927, a gene that is expressed in the ovary but currently has no known function.  The second is eIF3-S8, a transcription initiation factor.  The third is RpS24, a ribosomal protein.  The fourth is CG42565, which like CG6927, has no known function.  In the other two regions, I have narrowed down the cnA-act interacting genes to a small number of candidates, instead of the hundreds of genes within the original large region. I am currently testing the remaining candidates.",en_US,calmodulin,Identifying Genes that Interact with Calcineurin During Egg Activation in Drosophila melanogaster,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet commercial production in the US today is dominated by dent or semi-dent kernel type maize (Corn Belt dent), which has hard outer walls of endosperm surrounding a soft floury interior that when dried compacts to form the characteristic dent in the top of the kernel. One major exception is flint type corn, which is grown in areas of North America, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and many parts of Africa. Flint maize is characterized by its rounded vitreous outer endosperm and soft granular center and has desirable qualities such as cold tolerance, disease and insect resistance as well as longer storage capacity than many dent lines. 
The Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population parent inbred lines represent many of the major kernel types found in maize. In 2006 the entire NAM population of recombinant inbred lines were grown and scored visually for kernel type, in five locations. The NAM population contains 25 parents, of which, there are nine flint, nine semi-dent, four dent, two sweet and one popcorn parent lines, with a common dent parent, B73. Linkage mapping with ~7400 intervals markers was used to examine the genetics of kernel morphology. This yielded several areas of the genome that are significantly associated with the difference in kernel type seen in NAM. Several other major and minor QTL are shared across many families.

To assess the temporal response, trophoblasts grown in nutrient replete (complete; C) and nutrient restricted (NR) media were harvested at 0 to 96h; phosphorylated s6 ribosomal protein (s6rp) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) protein levels were measured using western analysis.

NR had a negative temporal effect on

HCF-1 modulates both lifespan and stress resistance by inhibiting the C. elegans homolog of the mammalian FOXO transcription factors, DAF-16. However, the involvement of other components in HCF-1 mediated longevity and stress resistance has not yet been characterized. We show that SKN-1, the C. elegans homolog of the mammalian Nrf proteins and a major orchestrator of the phase II detoxification response that defends against oxidative stress, is regulated by HCF-1 to modulate oxidative stress resistance but not lifespan. Our findings imply a novel regulatory relationship between HCF-1 and SKN-1 that is revealed only in the presence of oxidative stress.
2) Chromatin modifications are a major mechanism through which cells regulate gene expression. ChIP-seq allows for genome-wide profiling of any DNA-binding protein, including histones. To analyze these data, researchers have developed statistical tools that can identify genomic regions enriched for the DNA-binding protein of interest. Some histone marks, however, bind across broad regions of the genome and produce diffuse and high-noise data profiles that are often difficult to analyze. In this paper, I investigate the ability of peak-callers to analyze ChIP-seq data from H3K27me3, a histone mark known to produce broad regions of enrichment.

  Previous issue date: 2012-05",,,,,,,,,,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) prevalence in Great Lakes fish populations varies seasonally, with greater prevalence during spawning seasons. Chronic infections appear to be associated with neural tissue, while acute forms target endothelial tissue. Given the potential immunosurpessive effect of water temperature variation in natural environments, I investigated the effect of a 5ºC temperature change on disease development due to VHSV infection in fathead minnow Pimephales promelas. Fish were exposed to VHSV genotype IVb and either a temperature increase from 10ºC to 15ºC, decrease from 20ºC to 15ºC, or a stable temperature of 15ºC. I evaluated prevalence of gross lesions and death, tested fish for VHSV via cell culture of pooled visceral tissue, and performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays on brain tissue and pooled visceral tissue extracts. Fish that experienced temperature decrease had greater VHSV prevalence than those that experienced temperature increase, and more tested positive by qRTPCR of brain tissue than those that experienced no change, suggesting greater prevalence of infections. Visceral organ samples from fish that experienced either temperature change contained higher viral RNA N-gene copy numbers than those from fish that experienced stable temperature, while brain tissue
samples contained similar viral RNA copy numbers among all groups. In fish that contained more viral RNA copies in viscera than brain, those fish that experienced either temperature change had a greater difference between the two quantities than those that experienced no temperature change. The severity of chronic infections was not affected by temperature change, but the severity of acute infections was increased in fish that experienced any temperature change. These results suggest that fish that encounter temperature changes, especially decreases, of 5ºC are at higher risk of contracting chronic VHSV infections and severe acute VHSV infections, helping to explain seasonal fish die-offs attributed to VHSV, especially in fish that encounter temperature change during the spawning season.",en_US,,The Effect of Temperature Change on Viral Pathogenesis of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) in Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas),Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goals were to characterize the terrestrial locomotion of mummichogs and determine their method of navigation towards water in a terrestrial environment. We used high-speed video to record behavior during stranding experiments and found that mummichogs use a tail-flip jump to move overland, similarly to other Cyprinodontiformes. However, mummichogs also prop themselves upright into a prone position between each jump, a previously undescribed behavior. After becoming prone, mummichogs rotate about their vertical axis, directing the caudal fin towards the water. Then, they roll back onto their lateral aspect and use a tail-flip behavior to leap into a caudally-directed, ballistic flight path. We conducted experiments to determine the sensory stimulus used to locate a body of water by placing mummichogs on a square platform with one side adjacent to a sea table. Under artificial light, mummichogs moved towards the sea table with a higher frequency than towards the other sides. Under dark conditions, mummichogs did not show a preference for moving towards the sea table. When the surface of the water was covered with reflective foil, mummichogs moved towards it as if it were a body of water. These results suggest that mummichogs primarily use visual cues, specifically reflected light, to orient towards the water. The uprighting behavior that mummichogs perform between terrestrial jumps may provide an opportunity for these fish to receive visual information that allows them to safely return to the water.",en_US,Uprighting,Look before you leap: Visual navigation and terrestrial locomotion of the intertidal killifish Fundulus heteroclitus,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bemis, William",http://doi.org/10.7298/X4WM1BBJ,,

Currently, cancer treatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biological therapy, and targeted therapy. Within the past decade, there has been a huge upsurge in novel ideas and technology to combat this disease. From the 2000s, the Wiesner lab group has been working on silica-based nanomaterials for cancer “theranostics”. The first generation of Cornell dots (C dots) was fluorescent PEGylated silica nanoparticles used as diagnostic and therapeutic probes in cancer patient care. These particles have already been tested in first-in-human FDA-approved clinical trials, making them the first inorganic-polymer hybrid diagnostic bio-probe to enter clinical trials. They can be injected in the body, flow through the bloodstream, and be excreted without major side effects. The next generation C’ dots have been synthesized in aqueous solution to be even brighter particles than before. Brighter particles allow for clearer visualization in the body, which is especially beneficial when locating, imaging and excising a tumor. This is a valuable component of our particles because it allows for the effective treatment of cancer cells, while allowing healthy, living cells to remain unharmed.",en_US,Cornell Prime Dots,Cornell Prime Dots (C’ dots): Ultrasmall PEGylated fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles for cancer theranostics,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wiesner, Ulrich",,http://doi.org/10.7298/X4RV0KMT,

  Previous issue date: 2016-05",,,,,,,,,,"Grapevine red blotch-associated virus (GRBaV) is associated with red blotch disease which undermines optimal growth and development of grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Despite GRBaV’s significant economical and biological impacts, existing diagnostic methods lack sensitivity and consistency. This study has developed, optimized and employed a reliable quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) assay for the detection of GRBaV in a variety of host tissue types. Primers specific to GRBaV and an internal host control (NADP-dependent Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) were selected for use in qPCR based on their performance in initial validation tests. Controls consisted of 1) the internal GAPDH which served as relative reference of total input DNA and as a marker for template quality, 2) a dilution series of cloned target viral DNA, and 3) negative controls of water and total nucleic acid from uninfected vines. This method was then used to quantify the amount of GRBaV in multiple infected greenhouse- (GG) and field- (FG) grown vines. Absolute and relative quantification methods were shown to be strongly correlated (R2 > 0.84) for both GG and FG. Viral DNA quantities varied in different tissue types and from one plant to another between and within a location, but most significantly between GG and FG, where only 56.0% of the total samples from the latter were determined as positive compared to 98.4% for the former. Petioles were consistently found to contain higher amounts of GRBaV compared to their corresponding leaves (P≤0.0368). Leaves proximal to the main stem were also found to contain higher amounts of GRBaV compared to leaves located in the apical part of the cane (P≤0.0017). Based on these findings, it is recommended that total nucleic acid extracted from multiple petioles of fully developed leaves are used for robust and reliable GRBaV diagnosis using qPCR. The described qPCR assay and recommended sampling procedures will contribute to efforts in GRBaV containment and red blotch disease control.",en_US,relative quantification,The development of a quantitative assay for the detection of grapevine red blotch-associated virus in Vitis vinifera identifies significant differences in virus distribution,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Perry, Keith",,http://doi.org/10.7298/X4N29TWV,

Non-viral methods for genetic modification present several advantages over viral methods, and hence, such methods have been optimized for MSCs from a variety of species. Although equine MSCs have great importance, prior to this study, effective non-viral transfection parameters for these cells had not been determined. Here both chemical and physical transfection methods were optimized for equine MSCs, using red fluorescent protein as a reporter gene. Chemical reagents were optimized for reagent-to-DNA ratio, transfection solution plating volume, and cell density. Additionally, ideal voltage, cell concentration, DNA concentration, buffer, and pulse number settings were discovered for electroporation. The method resulting in highest gene expression was electroporation with one 30-msec pulse at 170 volts in Opti-Mem buffer. This technique resulted in transfection of 54% of the cell population, a percentage that is on the higher end of nonviral MSC transfection efficiencies. The transfection parameters determined in this study will undoubtedly be useful to all researchers who wish to genetically modify equine MSCs.",en_US,lipofection,Optimization of non-viral transfection methods for equine mesenchymal stem cells,Dissertation or Thesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nixon, Alan",,,
