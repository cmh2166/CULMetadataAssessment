This Metadata Assessment Workshop Curriculum is an open project that started with the Cornell University Library Metadata Working Group by [Christina Harlow][cmh]. We welcome contributions of all kinds from anyone interested in the topic:

- new lessons,
- new data or use case examples,
- fixes to existing material,
- bug reports,
- and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [this license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can. Everyone involved in this Metadata Assessment Curriculum work abides by the [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).

## What & How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to create an issue to tell us about typos, mistakes, or unclear wording. Additionally, examples or requests for examples with a certain metadata format, representation, namespace, or task are **always welcome**.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are smarter together than we are on our own. Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable: it's easy for people who have been using these lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so fresh eyes are always welcome.

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by email][contact].

2.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues]. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## Where to Contribute

If you wish to change the Metadata Assessment Workshop Curriculum, please work in <https://github.com/cmh2166/CULMetadataAssessment/tree/worksheet>.

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].

In brief:

1.  The published copy of the lesson is in the `gh-pages` branch of the repository
    (so that GitHub will regenerate it automatically). Please create all branches from that,
    and merge the [master repository][repo]'s `gh-pages` branch into your `gh-pages` branch
    before starting work. Please do *not* work directly in your `gh-pages` branch,
    since that will make it difficult for you to work on other contributions.

2.  We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
    2.  Commit the change in that branch.
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].
    5.  If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

Right now, [Christina Harlow][cmh] has final say over what material makes it into this particular curriculum. However, I'm happy to add other people as administrators on this repository who express an interest in maintaining, evolving, and supporting this curriculum.
